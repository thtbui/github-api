Image resizing is used to handle different resolutions between modules of various device screens and applications. It can also be used intentionally to corrupt or remove the original content of the image. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect external interference with the images.

Take a look at the ISSUE #1 before planning to submit your PR. It is one PR limited to one individual. This repository's aims to accept beginner friendly submissions and accepts medium sized scripts of code which can be used elsewhere example:- Text_to_speech Speech_to_text These particular python codes can be utilised in a larger python code-base that needs these for increasing interactivity on a website or making a personal assistant.  These BP can be altered depending on the code's complexity, length and usefullness  Uses:-   1. A collection of helpful code snippets.I have made that can be used for larger programs.    Open for users to contribute to the codebase so as to help each other out.Algorithms, Object detection algorithms,machine learning algorithms for AI/ML.   Basic templates and short codes to allow for creation of web-page elements as well as larger code scripts.    For example:-    The text_to_speech and speech_to_text codes can be used in a website so as to allow hearing impaired individuals to communicate their thoughts.   This can be inserted into a larger codebase for a larger set of individuals with different disabilities.   This could also used in websites so as to add extra functionality and cool features.   Parameters for bounty point allocation (Mandatory rules to be followed) :-    If you are submitting an AI/Model then you must specify the efficiency of the models.   Length of the code must not be lesser than 20 lines or greater than 200 lines unless explained to the maintainer why the code is in the spirit of this repository.   Must include Sufficient comments on your code for others to understand your script.   Also at the end of the file in comments please do indicate the uses of your script.   Examples of low quailty contributions:-  Note that your PR's will be scrutanised heavily if they follow the parameters and is limited to one PR per participant.   Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.   Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.   Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.   Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.   Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.   Proof of when the repo was made

Master Python (intermediate) 5. Python API Requests ← 🔥 your are here now   6. What next? Request a new tutorial or collaborate. We will feature your profile in our list of contributors  These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspells plese contribute and report them. One click installation:  Local Installation  Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:  $ npm i learnpack -g $ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python   Download this particular exercise using learnpack and cd into the folder:  $ learnpack download python-http-requests-api-tutorial-exercises $ cd python-http-requests-api-tutorial-exercises  Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a ""exercises"" folder that contains all the exercises within.  Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:  $ pip install pytest==4.4.2 mock pytest-testdox $ learnpack start Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated. How are the exercises organized? Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:  app.py: represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer. README.md: contains exercise instructions. test.py: you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

You might be wondering on how plagiarism detection on textual data is done, well it aint that complicated as you may think. We all all know that computer are good at numbers, so in order to compute the simlilarity between on two text documents, the textual  raw data is transformed into vectors => arrays of numbers and then from that we are going to use a basic knowledge vector to compute the the similarity between them. This repo consist of a basic example on how to do that. Dependencies Before you begin playing with the source code you might need to install deps just as shown below; pip3 install -r requirements.txt Running the App To run this code you need to have your textual document in your project directory with extension .txt and then when you run the script, it will automatically loads all the document with that extension and then compute the similarity between them just as shown below; $-> cd Plagiarism-checker-Python $ Plagiarism-checker-Python-> python3 app.py ('john.txt', 'juma.txt', 0.5465972177348937) ('fatma.txt', 'john.txt', 0.14806887549598566) ('fatma.txt', 'juma.txt', 0.18643448370323362)  Explore it Explore it and twist it to your own use case, in case of any question feel free to reach me out directly Issues Incase you have any difficulties or issues while trying to run the script you can raise it on the issues. Pull Requests If you have something to add I welcome pull requests on improvement , you're helpful contribution will be merged as soon as possible Give it a Star If you find this repo useful , give it a star so as many people can get to know it.

No queremos que se accedan directamente a ellos. Piensa que modificador de acceso es el más adecuado, también su tipo. Si quieres añadir algún atributo puedes hacerlo. Por defecto, todos los atributos menos el DNI serán valores por defecto según su tipo (0 números, cadena vacía para String, etc.). Sexo sera mujer por defecto. Se implantaran un constructor: Un constructor con todos los atributos como parámetro. Los métodos que se implementaran son: calcularIMC(): calculara si la persona esta en su peso ideal (peso en kg/(altura^2  en m)), devuelve un -1 si esta por debajo de su peso ideal, un 0 si esta en su peso ideal y un 1 si tiene sobrepeso . También devuelve el IMC. esMayorDeEdad(): indica si es mayor de edad, devuelve un booleano. introducirSexo(char sexo):  introducido el sexo. Si no es correcto, sera M. No sera visible al exterior. toString(): devuelve toda la información del objeto. generaDNI(): genera un numero aleatorio de 8 cifras, genera a partir de este su número su letra correspondiente. Este método sera invocado cuando se construya el objeto. Métodos set de cada parámetro, excepto de DNI.   Ahora, Pide por teclado el nombre, la edad, sexo, peso y altura. Crea 3 objetos de la clase anterior, el primer objeto obtendrá las anteriores variables pedidas por teclado, el segundo objeto obtendrá todos los anteriores menos el peso y la altura y el último los datos por defecto, para este último utiliza los métodos set para darle a los atributos un valor. Para cada objeto, deberá comprobar si esta en su peso ideal, tiene sobrepeso o por debajo de su peso ideal con un mensaje. Indicar para cada objeto si es mayor de edad. Por último, mostrar la información de cada objeto.    Crearemos una supeclase llamada Electrodoméstico con las siguientes características: Sus atributos son precio base, color, consumo energético (letras entre A y F) y peso. Indica que se podrán heredar. Por defecto, el color sera blanco, el consumo energético sera F, el precioBase es de 100 € y el peso de 5 kg. Usa constantes para ello. Los colores disponibles son blanco, negro, rojo, azul y gris. No importa si el nombre esta en mayúsculas o en minúsculas. Crearemos un constructor con todos los atributos. Los métodos que implementara serán: Métodos get de todos los atributos. comprobarConsumoEnergetico(char letra): comprueba que la letra es correcta, sino es correcta usara la letra por defecto. Se invocara al crear el objeto y no sera visible. comprobarColor(String color): comprueba que el color es correcto, sino lo es usa el color por defecto. Se invocara al crear el objeto y no sera visible. precioFinal(): según el consumo energético, aumentara su precio, y según su tamaño, también. Esta es la lista de precios: 	Letra	Precio 	A		100 € 	B		80 € 	C		60 € 	D		50 € 	E		30 € 	F		10 €  	Tamaño					Precio 	Entre 0 y 19 kg			10 € 	Entre 20 y 49 kg		50 € 	Entre 50 y 79 kg		80 € 	Mayor que 80 kg			100 €  Crearemos una subclase llamada Lavadora con las siguientes características: Su atributo es carga, ademas de los atributos heredados. Por defecto, la carga es de 5 kg. Usa una constante para ello. El constructor que se implementará será: Un constructor con la carga y el resto de atributos heredados.  Los métodos que se implementara serán: Método get de carga. precioFinal():, si tiene una carga mayor de 30 kg, aumentara el precio 50 €, sino es así no se incrementara el precio. Llama al método padre y añade el código necesario. Recuerda que las condiciones que hemos visto en la clase Electrodoméstico también deben afectar al precio. Crearemos una subclase llamada Television con las siguientes características: Sus atributos son resolución (en pulgadas) y fourK (booleano), ademas de los atributos heredados. Por defecto, la resolución sera de 20 pulgadas y el fourK sera false. Los constructor que se implementará será: Un constructor con el precio y peso. El resto por defecto. Los métodos que se implementara serán: Método get de resolución y fourK. precioFinal(): si tiene una resolución mayor de 40 pulgadas, se incrementara el precio un 30% y si tiene 4K, aumentara 50 €. Recuerda que las condiciones que hemos visto en la clase Electrodoméstico también deben afectar al precio. Ahora crea una clase ejecutable que realice lo siguiente: Crea una lista de Electrodomésticos de 10 elementos. Asigna a cada posición un objeto de las clases anteriores con los valores que desees. Ahora, recorre este array y ejecuta el método precioFinal(). Deberás mostrar el precio de cada clase, es decir, el precio de todas las televisiones por un lado, el de las lavadoras por otro y la suma de los Electrodomésticos (puedes crear objetos Electrodoméstico, pero recuerda que Television y Lavadora también son electrodomésticos). Por ejemplo, si tenemos un Electrodoméstico con un precio final de 300, una lavadora de 200 y una televisión de 500, el resultado final sera de 1000 (300+200+500) para electrodomésticos, 200 para lavadora y 500 para televisión.   3)Crearemos una clase llamada Serie con las siguientes características: Sus atributos son titulo, numero de temporadas, entregado, genero y creador. Por defecto, el numero de temporadas es de 3 temporadas y entregado false. El resto de atributos serán valores por defecto según el tipo del atributo. Crearemos un constructor con todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.  Los métodos que se implementara serán:     Métodos get de todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.     Métodos set de todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.     Sobreescribe los métodos toString.  Crearemos una clase Videojuego con las siguientes características:  Sus atributos son titulo, horas estimadas, entregado, genero y compañía. Por defecto, las horas estimadas serán de 10 horas y entregado false. El resto de atributos serán valores por defecto según el tipo del atributo. Crearemos un constructor  con todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.  Los métodos que se implementara serán:     Métodos get de todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.     Métodos set de todos los atributos, excepto de entregado.    Implementa los anteriores métodos en las clases Videojuego y Serie. Ahora crea una aplicación  y realiza lo siguiente:  Crea dos listas, uno de Series y otro de Videojuegos, de 5 posiciones cada uno. Crea un objeto en cada posición de la lista, con los valores que desees. Entrega algunos Videojuegos y Series con el método entregar(). Cuenta cuantos Series y Videojuegos hay entregados. Al contarlos, devuélvelos. Por último, indica el Videojuego tiene más horas estimadas y la serie con mas temporadas.

Python Language was used for creating this project. About Now a days, as the entire world is suffering from COVID-19 and it ha sbecome one of the most deadliest virus in the world. Almost entire world suffered through this. This Project is a small effort to aware people regarding the COVID-19 cases in the world and its related stats. Tech Stack I have coded this project using Python,. This project has very minimal UI, in order to avoid complications. Though This project can also be created by any other programming languages such as - C#,C++ or JAVA Conclusion This project has been made with Python, and currently its UI have been kept extreamly simple, but few tweaks have to be made by me in UI to make this look more beautiful and appealing, the code will also be optimized a bit.

Email Course JSON is a common, convenient medium for data exchange. However, collaborators often find it challenging to similarly exchange the intended meanings of JSON objects, their fields, and their field values. Furthermore, one often wants to search the data in ways that do not fit the JSON object schema as given, or that otherwise require many ""joins"" across JSON object collections. What if there was a way to embed a JSON document's meaning within it, so that terminology definitions accompany the data on exchange? What if any JSON object could be decomposed into a graph of constituent facts, where the graph could either be searched directly or recomposed into a JSON object schema more appropriate for a given application? There are open protocols, standards, and Python-based tools to help you with all of the above. I'd like to take you on a journey through nobelprize.org's open data on Nobel prizes and laureates. Through the lenses of Linked Data, MongoDB, and Python, you'll learn about knowledge graphs, document-oriented databases, and how they are related. The promise of this course is that you will learn how to disseminate your research data as supplementary information to articles in a way that is more aligned with FAIR principles –findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable – and therefore increase the likelihood that your published results are cited and used. Here is an outline of topics I will cover over six (6) emails:  Linked Data  Representing facts: RDF graphs via RDFLib Representing terminology: RDFS and OWL Knowledge graph search: SPARQL   JSON-LD and search over a collection of documents  Representing entities: collections and JSON documents Framing linked-data subgraphs as documents: JSON-LD via the PyLD processor Document collection search: MongoDB via the PyMongo driver    To sign up for this free email course, let me know at donny@polyneme.xyz.

The goals of this short course on Python is to give a basic introduction. By the end of this workshop you should:  Program using Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and gain familiarity with Ipython Notebooks Manipulate simple variable types, operators and conditions Write loops and functions Gain familiarity with data science libraries: Numpy, Pandas and MatplotLib  The exercises for this workshop are organized into Jupyter Notebooks which is a way of serving executable Python code on a web page. A local Jupyter server can be run by installing it with Anaconda (or Miniconda), or through the internet using Google's Colaboratory service. Slides can also be viewed online at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/estherpuyol/BHF_Python_workshop Getting Started With Colaboratory In this workshop, we will be using Google Colaboratory to run our notebooks, but if you want you can run all the notebooks. To get going with Colab:  Go to https://colab.research.google.com (be sure to be logged into your Google account beforehand) Click on the Github tab and enter https://github.com/estherpuyol/BHF_Python_workshop/ into the search box A number of notebooks should appear, double click the one to load. You can start using the notebooks by clicking on the run icons to the left of each cell or press ctrl+Enter. (You will get popups about the notebook not being authored by Google and other things, just click Yes to these)  Installing Python Locally If you want to run locally, you need to install Python 3.7, Numpy, Jupyter, and Matplotlib. These can be installed separately through the standard distributions from the sites for each package, or using a managed package system like Anaconda/Miniconda. The fastest way is with Miniconda:  Go to https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html and download the Python 3.7 64bit installer for your OS. Install Miniconda, checking the box to set the PATH variable In the Start Menu, go to ""Anaconda3"" -> ""Anaconda Prompt"" Type conda install jupyter matplotlib to install the components needed. To start Jupyter, from this console type jupyter notebook  The complete but slow way is with Anaconda.  Go to https://www.anaconda.com/distribution and download the Python 3.7 graphical installer for your OS. Install Anaconda, following instructions here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ Start the Anaconda Navigator program Navigate to ""Environments"" and click on ""base (root)"" On the right side click ""Update index..."" Once that completes set the drop-down menu to show all and type ""Pandas"" into the search box Pandas 1.3.3 should show up, select it and install Return to home and launch Jupyter Notebook. This should bring to your browser with the notebook server running. From here you can navigate to the workshop directory and start a notebook.

Opening any python file in this repo and issuing :vimspector#Launch() should just work. However, I have found that adding stopAtEntry: true does nothing, and hence you need to first add a breakpoint; otherwise, I guess by the time vimspector connects and issues that first stop command, the debugpy process is already finished executing the script.

It would be optimal to execute this program in google colab(Execute the notebook file in that google colab),unless you wish to run it as python code which could result in some errors. Purpose:- The purpose of this system is to allow users to get recommendations for their favourite shows and a further aim for anyone to find the best possible recommendation for any item as long as its data is specified in the .csv file . Libraries needed for the program are:-  import networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import numpy as np import math as math import time  Additional features to be added:-   Add a GUI.  Add more features which can be connected to the file(rather than just genre).  Add a file uploader in the GUI to allow for different files to be used as well as the option to alter the options on which the recommendations must be searched.  Allow for a search function in GUI to allow the user to view the titles of the websites from the .csv file.  How to contribute:- Make you way to the contrinuting.md file . Note screenshots for each PR is needed.

417085193;py-despat;https://github.com/zarcen/py-despat;Python;2021-10-14T10:24:26Z;0;0;0;"Design Pattern using python implementation Introduction Prerequisite  python3 (python-3.9.5) pip/pip3 (pip-20.0.2) pytest (pytest-6.2.4)  This repo demonstrates various design patterns implementation in python. The goal is to maintain quick templates as these patterns would be used over and over during development 😐. Why python 🤔? Well, most design patterns are naturally derived from OOP languages like Java or C#. There are tons of samples already when there's a need to bring up things from scratch with Java by applying certain pattern. On the other hand, not so common for python. File Layout For each pattern, it is structured as follows.  Note: It is simply to be a package by putting an empty __init__.py pattern_foo/     __init__.py               # needed to be treated as a pacakge     pattern_foo_cxt1_abc.py   # ""_abc"" suffix as abstract class     pattern_foo_cxt2_abc.py     ...     tests/         __init__.py           # needed to be treated as a pacakge         test_pattern.py To run the test for a pattern: $ pytest <pattern_name> Quick Pattern Links  Strategy Pattern Observer Pattern Command Pattern  SOLID Principles of OO Design   Single respoinsibilie A class should have only single one responsibility   Open-closed A class should be open to extension, usually by inheritance. But close to modification.   Liskov substitution Subclasses should be able to stand in for their parents in a program without breaking anything   Interface segregation Many specific interfaces are better than one do-it-all interface. (In python, using abstract base classes combined with multiple inheritance to achieve this)   Dependency inversion Program toward abstrations not implementations.   Abstraction Base Class Definition Sadly, PEP8 doesn't have naming convention for abc (Abstract Base Class). Here, just use I prefix as the notation like other languages like C++ or Java According to module abc, simply inheriting from abc.ABC is the recommended way to define a ABC. from abc import ABC  class IFoo(ABC):     """"""Abstract Base Class Definition""""""      # Define a abstract method     @abc.abstractmethod     def do_something(self, val):         """"""Required method""""""      # Define a abstract property     @abc.abstractproperty     def some_property(self):         """"""Required property"""""" Concrete Class Implementation Derived class inherits the ABC. Like C++, python supports multiple inheritance. Say, Foo implements two ABCs: IFoo and IBar class Foo(IFoo, IBar):     """"""Implementation of IFoo and IBar""""""      def __init__(self, val=None):         self._val = val      def do_something(self, val):         """"""Implementation of abstract method""""""         self._val += 10          @property     def some_property(self):         """"""Implementation of abstract property""""""         return self._val          @property     def bar_property(self):         return self._bar Strategy Pattern  Classification: Behavioral Family of algorithms Encapsulate each one Make them interchangeable Algorithms vary independently Also know as: Policy Pattern  Observer Pattern  Classification: Behavioral One to many relationship Between a set of objects When the state of one changes… Its dependents are notified Also know as: Dependents pattern or Publish-Subscribe pattern Used a lot in GUI In MVC pattern: Model = Subject, Viewer = Observer  Command Pattern  Classification: Behavioral Encapsulate a request as an object Parameterize objects Queues and log operations Undoable operations and macros Also know as: Action pattern or Transaction pattern Useful for command line programs and menu like applications (each menu item is like a command) Easy to provide validation and undo for a command  "

In diesem Programmierkurs für Python sollen die Schülerinnen und Schüler Grundlagenkenntnisse in Python erhalten. Ziel ist es, die Mathe^SH-Vorträge um kleinere Programmierprojekte zu erweitern, mit denen man komplexere und größere Rechnungen automatisieren kann, um ein besseres Verständnis zu den Themen zu erhalten. Ebenso sollen die Schülerinnen und Schüler einen Eindruck erhalten, wie angewandte Mathematiker arbeiten. Evaluationstest Im Evaluationstest sollen Schülerinnen und Schüler mit Vorkenntnissen testen können, ob sich der Einführungskurs für sie lohnt. Sicherlich gibt es immer Themen, die noch neu sind, bei bereits bekannten Themen ließen sich aber schon kompliziertere Projekte umsetzen.

To run it, simply call the file script.py in the terminal. In each round, the board's snakes and ladders will be generated randomly. Gameplay Up to four people can play the game. Theoretically, there should be no limit on the number of players, but the wait time between the players will be too long if too many players are involved. The player can choose to set the size of the square board (n*n) limited between 8x8 to 12x12. Both lower and upper limits are theoretical; too low and it jeopardises the number of snakes and ladders that can be set on the board, and too high and it makes gameplay too long while the grid will also not fit in a standard terminal. Each board will have the same number of snakes to ladders. The player can set this amount, but the maximum number is n - 3 (n being the length of the board). This is to ensure that there will be as many snakes and ladders set on the board. The script can recognise if there is no appropriate square that can be set as snake tail or ladder bottom/top. It is therefore possible for fewer snakes or ladders to be generated than requested. The board can be re-generated prior to the gameplay if the players are not happy with the snakes and ladders generated on the board. 1 or 2 dies can be used. No extra roll is given if the player rolls a 6 or 12. The player wins if they roll more than the required amount of steps to reach the end square (ie if s is the steps to the end square, player wins as long as dice_roll > s). There is no need to roll a precise amount. The Board After each dice roll, the script will print out the current state of the board. Each square is numbered, and may contain the following letters at the right side of the number:  SHXX: this refers to Snake Head. The number XX refers to where the snake tail (and hence the square the player will end up on) is. ST: this refers to Snake Tail. LBXX: this refers to Ladder Bottom. The number XX refers to where the ladder top (and hence the square the player will end up on) is. LT: this refers to Ladder Top.  The left side of each square number may show the players' tokens. Players can occupy the same square without any consequences. Files  script.py: This is the file that runs the game. test.py: This file contains testing functions, specifically the generation of snakes and ladders. script_testing.py: This file is a carbon copy of script.py, except that print statements are uncommented. This file is used for testing.  "

Using pykakasi (a python lib) to finish the process of converting. I just use node.js to Call the python file so that I can use the method of node.js to launch a server which can help me convert the Japanese text. (Actually I didn't manage to learn the flask, so I continue my project in the way.)  Environment Need node.js and python3.6+ pykakasi (a python lib) Install/Use Ignore the process of installing node.js and python   install pykakasi in pip pip install pykakasi   download the file and upzip it   open the terminal in the dir npm install   now the deployment is over   launch the node server (default port is 3000, you can change it in file ""main.js"") node main.js   test it on your browser (GET method)    http://127.0.01:3000/user?content=大丈夫&mode=ToRoma  ""大丈夫"" in the ""content"" can be replaced by your own text ""ToRoma"" means converting text to roma, you can use ""ToHira"" to convert it to Hiragana and “ToKana” to convert it to Katakana.    Arguments Value Introduction     content any japanese text like ""大丈夫"" The text need to be converted   mode ToRoma/ToHira/ToKana The convert mode.If you don't input,  the default mode is ToRoma    Tips   The return value is json like this:  {""url"":""/user?content=%E5%A4%A7%E4%B8%88%E5%A4%AB"",""rText"":""大丈夫"",""output"":""daijoubu \r\n""}    The default method of this API is GET. You can also use POST but it's not supported well at present. I'll update it in the near future.   If you have to use POST in this imperfect version, you can put your text in the content of POST, and you will get its roma in return. (Now POST support ToRoma only). The return value is text.   There will be a file called ""data.txt"" in the running path. It's used to convey text from javascript to python.    "

Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. Telecom companies predict whether a customer will be stop using their services or not. Problem statement Build a ML model to predict the customer churn for a telecom company. Rationale If it is predicted that a customer will stop using the services, the companies can take actions by giving him/her several offers, vouchers and discounts. How To Run  Download the project. The project is inside the Telecom Customer Churning directory. Open the Churn.ipynb file jupyter notebook. Run all the cells. Enter the customer ID you want to find. You will get the result.  Implementation In this project, Machine Learning using Python have been used and developed with Jupyter Notebook.  The dataset is given in churn.csv file which was downloaded from Kaggle. After the prediction is done, a new column ""action"" is added which stores the appropriate comments. Customer ID can be entered to fetch the required action of a particular customer.  Note This project is meant for learning purposes only. Feel free to use the code if needed.  The project is not deployed on any application. It is just the development of the ML part.

417173206;pypacker;https://github.com/syegulalp/pypacker;Python;2021-10-14T14:57:49Z;0;0;0;PyPacker: a dumb little script for turning Python apps into standalone executable packages on Windows PyPacker is my attempt at creating a way to make Python apps fully portable on Windows. It does this by performing live program analysis to determine what to pack up. Rationale Most systems for turning Python apps into standalone programs analyze the program to determine what and how to pack things up, but don't actually run the program in question, and so have no information about the program's runtime behavior. PyPacker runs the program and makes a record of all the imports actually used during the program's lifetime. It then uses this information to create a standalone redistributable of the application. The downside of this approach is that you have to perform at least one run with the program that provides the broadest possible program coverage -- e.g., all imports are fully executed, etc. The upside is that PyPacker knows exactly what to copy. Also, your trace files can be reused as long as no new program components have been added in the meantime. Usage Run it like so: py -m pypacker -a entry_point.py where entry_point.py is the entry point to your application. Your application will launch. Run it and make sure you use as much of its functionality as possible, to generate the maximum possible coverage. When your application exits, PyPacker it will generate a tracefile.json file that can be re-used for future runs (by just typing py -m pypacker in that directory). It will then package your application for redistribution. The resulting redistributable will be placed in the dist subdirectory. A zipped version of the redistributable directory is also provided. What PyPacker tries to do  The main program tree is turned into a .zip file (of .pyc files). Any non-Python files in the main program tree are copied into a parallel directory off the root of the dist directory. Usage of .pyd files and (some) .dlls are automatically detected as well and copied. Third-party packages are also included. Both console and windowed executables are provided.  Note that PyPacker works best with a program structure like this: entrypoint.py     \ appdir  where entrypoint.py is what's executed to start your app, and your actual app and all its files live in appdir and below. This makes it easier for PyPacker to detect data files that are adjacent to your application. Caveats Very buggy. Drastically incomplete. For instance, stuff like NumPy probably doesn't work yet.

417179329;twitterCleanUp;https://github.com/DavesWork19/twitterCleanUp;C++;2021-10-14T15:13:44Z;0;0;0;Twitter Clean Up - A way to help people clean up and be more aware of their Twitter posts. There are two .py files, two .cpp files and one .hpp to run this code. During the first Python code, the user is asked to input their Twitter username and then follows by asking how many days back would they like to view their tweets. After the user enters in all their information the Python code uses the Twitter API to extract all of their tweets up to the entered day and stores them in a .txt file for later parsing. Once the python code has concluded, the c++ code starts to run which takes all the tweets from the .txt file and stores them into a stack implemented with linked lists to be examined. Once the stack has been created the user is then prompted with 3 options. Option 1, is to cross-reference all of the users tweets with a generated list of offensive words and phrases. Option 2, is to cross-reference all of the users tweets with a word or phrase that the user enters. While option 3, exits the program and deletes all the users saved information, such as the linked lists of all their tweets, the linked list of their offensive tweets and the .txt file containing all their tweets. If the user chooses option 1 or 2 the program will find all of their offensive posts and flag them. Once a post has been flagged it is then stored in another stack implemented by linked lists so the most recent tweet is at the top. Once the final stack of only offensive words has been created, the user is taken through the entire stack and asked if they would like to delete or keep each offensive post. If the user chooses to delete one of their posts, that post is then stored into a .txt file to be deleted later using another python code that uses the Twitter API to delete posts.

Sommaire  Fonctionnalités Objectifs Installation Utilisation pychat-lite Limitations connues Contacte, Contributions et plus  Fonctionnalités  Les messages sont chiffrés de bout en bout avec AES-128-OCB. La clé de chiffrement peut être chargée manuellement ou générée puis échangée automatiquement en sécurité avec RSA. Notifications de bureau sur Windows et Linux (désactivable). L'empreinte de la clé de chiffrement peut être copiée pour vérifier le chiffrement de bout en bout. Système de citations (>>citation>>message)  Objectifs  Simple et minimaliste : Il doit être simple d'utilisation et léger. Il n'a pas vocation à remplacer WhatsApp... Sécurité : Les communications doivent rester privées. Avare en information : L'hôte et le port doivent être les seules informations connues sur un correspondant. Absolument rien ne doit être conservé après la fermeture.  Installation Non valable pour pychat-lite Python 3.5+ est requis. Dans le même répertoire que pychat, utiliser la commande suivante pour installer les dépendances python: py -m pip install -r requirements.txt  Si vous rencontrez des problèmes lors de l'installation du module pycryptodome, référez-vous à sa documentation: ici pour Windows et ici pour Linux. Utilisation Pour lancer pychat : Sur Linux, accorder les permissions nécessaires pour l'exécuter: sudo chmod +x pychat.py ./pychat.py  Sur Windows: pychat.py  Pour utiliser pychat : L'un des deux correspondants devra lancer pychat en mode serveur pour attendre le client. Dans ce cas, penser à ouvrir le port utilisé (12800 par défaut) sur le routeur : pychat.py -s  L'autre devra alors utiliser le mode client en précisant l'hôte (ip) du serveur. pychat.py -c -i HOTE   Pour fermer la connexion active, utilisez la commande !close. Une erreur commune en lançant le serveur: Erreur: ce port est déjà utilisé.  Dans ce cas, utiliser un port différent ou fermer le terminal puis le rouvrir. pychat-lite Une version allégée est disponible dans la branche pychat-lite. Le but étant de réduire au maximum son poids, pychat lite ne chiffre pas les messages et beaucoup de fonctionnalités y sont absentes.

Models The Calculator model uses the compute service to co-ordinate calculator actions. The ComputeEngine models handle parsing and calculations.  There are two compute engine models available:  SimpleComputeEngine ComplexComputeEngine  The ComplexComputeEngine is a subclass of the SimpleComputeEngine. The simple engine provides +, -, * and / operations on integers only.  Input must be space delimited. The complex engine adds ^ (power) and % (modulus) operations and can handle floats.  Space delimiting is not required for inputs. Services The ComputeService is used to inject ComputeEngine dependencies into the Calculator model.

You can also generate its docs from the source code. Simply change directory to the doc subfolder and type in make html, the documentation will be under build/html. You will need Sphinx to build the documentation. Usage There are two files to perform the classification:  cnn.py - Script to run only the CNN. classfiers.py - Script to run the rest of classifiers.  The command to execute each script is as follows: $ python3 script data_train.npy labels_train.npy data_test.npy labels_test.npy MRMR.csv where:  script is cnn.py or classifiers.py. data_train.npy is the file with the training dataset data (in .npy format). labels_train.npy is the file with the training dataset labels (in .npy format). data_test.npy is the file with the test dataset data (in .npy format). labels_test.npy is the file with the test dataset labels (in .npy format). MRMR.csv is the file with mRMR features ranking (in .csv format).  Finally, once the script is finished, the accuracy of each method will be saved in a local database using the PyMongo library.

417144633;website_element_painter;https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/website_element_painter;Python;2021-10-14T13:38:21Z;0;0;0;I was tired of manually changing all my headers, footers, and head code. There are options - yes. You have PHP, but that is server side and with my website being hosted on GitHub for now, that's not an option. Javascript and html_include is probably the best option out there for this, and it is probably better than this solution. That said, Javascript adds weight and reliability issues that I'm not sure I want to deal with. So I wrote this little script to automate the update of headers, footers, and heads. It is dead simple, and relies on a human marking each of their pages with HTML comments. The thing is, it's simple to understand, all the processing is done locally with the developer (me), so mistakes are caught immediately and before they are published, and all my webpages remain plain HTML and CSS for maximum speed. How It Works Wrap your head, headers, and footers with HTML comments. These MUST be on their own lines in the code. Your elements can go in their respective files in the templates directory, they are .txt, and if you want them to be active HTML just change the extensions in the Python code. All the pages you want to include should be listed, separated by newlines in the _includes.txt file. Headers Look Like This: \<!--HEADER BEGINS HERE-->  *HEADER CONTENT*  \<!--HEADER ENDS HERE-->  Footers Look Like This: \<!--FOOTER BEGINS HERE-->  *FOOTER CONTENT*  \<!--FOOTER ENDS HERE-->  Heads Look Like This: \<!--HEAD BEGINS HERE-->  *HEAD CONTENT*  \<!--HEAD ENDS HERE-->  The Python script will read the file, remove the lines with the old elements, replace them with the new elements, wipe the old code, and write the new code. Yes it's a little scary that the file is wiped and then written to. There are some safety checks to make sure you have valid tags and so forth, and only when eveything is in place does the truncation and write happen, so it should be pretty safe. I could have the script create a backup that it cleans up in case of some error, but honestly, I'm not worried enough about that edge case, and Git exists. 
417101557;ExtractDat3;https://github.com/douglascoenen/ExtractDat3;Python;2021-10-14T11:22:10Z;0;0;0;ExtractDat3 Python 3 version of John Hartman's Python 2.7 Extractdat (see https://github.com/jhh67/extractdat). The whole documentation and associated paper is within their repository. Here, the magic methods of the different classes and the writing methods have been changed to match Python 3. Also, the CLI and Drag and Drop has been replaced by the python built-in library Tkinter to create a GUI and pick files. The program behaves the same in terms of processing and saving files. Another addition was the option of loading bars by using the amazing tqdm package. It is not necessary to have it, but if installed, will be used to create loading bars for each .dat files and scans. To use this program now, you just have to either double-click on it to launch it or execute the script from the terminal. If there is any comments, feedback or feature requests I would be very happy to answer them! I also plan to translate RecoverDat.py in a similar manner when I will have time.

417154837;pose-mapper;https://github.com/MathiasBaumgartinger/pose-mapper;Python;2021-10-14T14:07:05Z;0;0;0;"Pose-Mapper A Blender-Python plugin and the required preprocessing for mapping pose-estimated data onto a generic model. The current version uses a model exported from !(Makehuman)[http://www.makehumancommunity.org/] in the Makehuman 2 standard (.mhx). The plugin offers the application of multiple video-sequences one by one onto the same model. For instance motions over the course of a cutscene can be mapped. The scene has to be manually cut in before. Usage The workflow currently includes 4 major steps:  Finding an (appropriate) video-sequence Preprocessing Exporting and loading a model from Makehuman Application on the model  Prerequisites  mediapipe >= 0.8.4.2 opencv >= 4.0.1 MHX2 plugin for blender (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/plugins.html)  Step 1: Finding an (appropriate) video-sequence In the current state, finding an appropriate video sequence is quite challenging. There are certain factors that have a major impact on the accuracy of the pose tracker. The main criteria I found to achieve good results are:  Only one person on screen The pose-tracker can only track one person at a time - with multiple persons it will mix them up frequently and thus produce heavy inaccuracies Camera movement Optimally the camera should not move at all, as any movement on the camera will be mapped to the model High resolutions I have noticed that the higher the resolution of the video, the higher the output quality Full shots The more of the body is visible the less has to predicted by magic. Contrast between person and background A high contrast makes finding movement for the predictor a lot easier  Step 2: Preprocessing Preprocessing in the case of this repository describes the process of creating a JSON with positions of landmarks (as described in under https://google.github.io/mediapipe/images/mobile/pose_tracking_full_body_landmarks.png) frame by frame. The preprocessing used here is based on the . Usage: python ./preprocess/mp_pose_preprocess.py <path_to_video> <destination_file> Step 3: Exporting and loading a model from Makehuman Exporting the desired model from Makehuman as .mhx2 file and loading the model into blender using the MHX2 plugin described in the prerequisites (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/plugins.html). A generic model from Makehuman is inside the directory models/standard.mhx2. The application can be applied on any model of the .mhx2 standard, just make sure to assign the name of the model inside of blender to MODEL_NAME.  Step 4a: Application on the model With a correct setup, from here one just needs to open the pose-application.py in blender, tune the constants accordingly (more information under Configuration) and run the script. The results can be best obtained in the ""Animation"" tab of Blender.  Step 4b: Visualizing with ""plain.py"" Another visualization of the data is provided by means of the plain-object. With it only the landmarks are being depicted according to the pose-estimator inside of blender without a matching model. Step 4a and 3 are not necessary for this visualization. I recommend not to use a plain and a model inside the same blender execution as it causes bugs.  Configuration pose_application  PATH_PREFIX  importlib.util sadly did not work with relative paths for me so you have to define the root to the location of this git repo on your local machine E.g.: ""C:/sem2/P1/implementations/pose-estimation/""   MODEL_NAME  The model name as depicted in Blender in the scene-collection   DATA_PATHS  Give the path to any number of preprocessed jsons in here. A new json will be handled as ""cut"". E.g.: [PATH_PREFIX + ""preprocess/output/walking.json"", PATH_PREFIX + ""preprocess/output/sit_down_fixed.json""]   DISTANCE_FACTOR  How much the location of the screen space (0-1) of model in the pose estimator is being multiplied with   AVG_OVER_N_FRAMES  How many frames should be averaged (applying each estimated frame makes it very jittery)   FRAMES_BETWEEN  How many keyframes blender should put between the i-th video   CONNECTIONS  How the PoseBones in Blender should be connected, it might be necessary to change this if one uses another estimator/model, otherwise i suggest leaving this the way it is    preprocess  BODY_PARTS  Defines which way to name the bones identified by 0 to 32 from https://google.github.io/mediapipe/images/mobile/pose_tracking_full_body_landmarks.png. It should match the CONNECTIONS from the pose-application as well as the model's according bones    Limitations  Jittering: As of now the mapping is very jittery. Increasing AVG_OVER_N_FRAMES makes this better, leads to other bugs in some cases however. No ""real-life"" body constraints: Sometimes body-parts are overlapping/pointing in directions which are actually not possible Only one person: As mentioned before only one person can be tracked Camera perspectives: Camera perspectives might distort the way the pose-estimator estimates the coordinates Camera movement: Camera movement appears as model movement in the end, the model would need to be focussed in the middle Translation calculated hard-coded: The translation is as of now hardcoded with DISTANCE_FACTOR Cuts have to be marked manually: If the video has a cutscene, the scene must be manually cut and then individually preprocessed Only arms and legs: Only arms and legs are being tracked at the moment. It would be further possible to track fingers/head/etc..  Credits The preprocessing script was heavily influenced by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brwgBf6VB0I&t=750s. All this is based on the mighty work of mediapipe's pose-estimator. Kudos to the Makehuman community! "

The aim of the project The project task was to implement a model in the python language for predicting the autism spectrum in children. Data from the website were used for this task: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Autistic+Spectrum+Disorder+Screening+Data+for+Children++ The dataset used had a total of 292 different patient outcomes for 19 variables. Based on the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, it was necessary to prepare the data, and then create and learn a model and test it on unused data. 2. Libraries used For the python 3.6 interpreter:  scipy - for importing data from a file, numpy - for mathematical operations on columns, pandas - for storing and processing data in tables, pandasgui - to display results in tables, tensorflow and keras - libraries used for machine learning, sklearn - data processing and creation of performance metrics.  Note: The versions of individual libraries can be found in the requirements.txt file 3. Setup environment a) with Anaconda Anaconda is a great program for creating virtual environments. It makes it much easier to work with different projects and versions of libraries. To run this project, it is recommended to create a new environment and follow the methods given below: We run the anaconda-promt program. Once in the (base) environment, enter the commands as below: Create a conda environment conda create -n robmed-env  Activation of environment conda activate robmed-env  Installing libraries (go to the directory where the project folder is located): conda install --file requirements.txt  Launch the script python main.py  If the script was successfully run, the model training process will start. There will also be a table showing how the model performed on the test data. In addition, in the folder in the Models directory there will be a ready trained model. Note: If you used a terminal and would like to display the data in the pandasgui tables (commented out by default), you may run into an error. So it is recommended to use programs like Pycharm or Spyder when we want to use this library and edit the code. b) using Pycharm We launch Pycharm and create a new project. We choose the base python interpreter. It is important that this is the python 3.6 version. Additionally, we create a new virtual environment (if you have already completed the step with creating the conda environment, we can use it here).  We move the contents of the Autism_Classification folder to the project folder and open the main.py file. To install the libraries we open a terminal and then use the command: pip install -r requirements.txt  At this point, we can already run the program in the pycharm environment. 4. Code overview a) Data preparation The data retrieved from the page is located in the dataset folder in the Autism-Child-Data.arff file. Therefore, they should be transferred to the program variables. The scipy library and the arff.loadarff method were used to load the data. After loading the data, you had to use the pandas library and decode the data to the utf-8 format. Below is a table of already loaded variables.  In order to create a network and to best learn a model, important data must be properly processed and unnecessary columns should be removed. Removed columns:  Age group - it was exactly the same for all children. The variable could be used for a larger database of different age groups. However, this information was useless for this problem. Country of residence, nationality, application used - when training the model, it turned out that these parameters did not affect the learning outcomes. The effects of these variables were investigated, but their use could only worsen the results. Autism - this column has also been removed because this parameter is our value that we want to predict. So it had to be placed in a different buffer.  Processed columns:  Gender, jaundice, ASD - men / woman and yes / no values have been changed to 1 and 0, Relatives - values changed to Parent - 0, self - 1, Health Care profesional -2,? - 3.  The finished data set for the student was divided as follows: Total data size: 292 Train data size: 183 Valid data size: 21 Data size test: 88    Total data size: 292     Train data size: 183   Valid data size: 21   Data size test: 88    Prepared table of variables for learning.  b) Training the model. Once the data had been prepared, the model creation could begin. model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(14, input_dim=14, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])  The model was declared sequential. The neurons in the input layer had a value equal to the number of parameter columns. Additionally, one hidden layer consisting of 8 neurons and the relu activation function was used. The output layer returned the logical value of the parameter, i.e. 1 - for autism and 0 - none. 50 epochs were used for teaching. The results that were obtained are listed below Epoch 50/50 - 0s - loss: 0.0261 - acc: 1.0000 - val_loss: 0.0231 - val_acc: 1.0000  Already after 15 epochs, the accuracy of the model was 100%, but the number of epochs was increased due to the high value of the loss function, which only after 50 epochs remained at the level of about 2.5%. c) Model testing. The model was used on previously unused test data. The performance metric was used to visualize the effectiveness:    - precision recall f1-score support     avg / total 1.00 1.00 1.00 88    A good result was obtained for 100% of the data, which proves the high accuracy of the network.

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing. The source for this project is available here. Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the setup.py file, an example of which is included in this project. You should edit this file accordingly to adapt this sample project to your needs.  This is the README file for the project. The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using reStructuredText or markdown with the appropriate key set. It will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for that purpose. Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a good idea, although a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version may be appropriate.

Используется формат YAML. Логины и пароли Файл secrets.yml содержит пароли для доступа к коммутаторам. Можно использовать как образец config/secrets.sample.yml, переименовать, и вписать свои данные.  admin_profile - профиль для узловых коммутаторов user_profile - профиль для коммутаторов уровня доступа  --- secrets:   admin_profile:     login: admin     password: adminpassword   user_profile:     login: user     password: userpassword ... Основные модули sw.py  Используется для подключения к коммутаторам и работы с ними  Можно запускать как отдельный скрипт, так и импортировать классы и функции. $ ./sw.py IP COMMAND IP ip-адрес коммутатора, поддерживается сокращенный формат x.x, в этом случае подразумевается 192.168.x.x. Практически все консольные утилиты из данного репозитория поддерживают как полный, так и сокращенный формат записи ip. COMMAND show Выводит краткую информацию о коммутаторе в виде строки формата: model [short_ip] location [--full]  Расположение коммутатора будет выделено цветом:  зеленый - обычные коммутаторы доступа ярко-красный - центральные свитчи ярко-желтый - узловые свитчи с маршрутизацией ярко-зеленый - узловые расширители портов 1G ярко-синий - узловые расширители портов 10G ярко-голубой - GPON на АТС бледно-синий - узловые расширители портов 10G с урезанной CLI серый - GPON на Осипенко, Huawey на АТС, доступа к CLI нет  Если указан флаг --full, второй строчкой выводится mac-адрес устройства. connect Подключается к коммутатору через telnet и передает управление пользователю. Стандартное приветствие коммутатора заменяется короткой строкой, генерируемой описанной выше командой show. Заголовок окна также меняется на [short_ip] location send Отправляет одну или несколько команд на коммутатор, возвращает результат выполнения команд. Команды можно разделять либо символом ';', либо новой строкой. Пустые строки и отступы при этом игнорируются. db.py  Используется для работы с локальной базой данных коммутаторов  Можно запускать как отдельный скрипт, так и импортировать классы и функции. Данные хранятся в директории data. Используется база данных SQLite. Генерация актуальной базы данных $ ./db.py generate В этом режиме из базы удаляются все старые записи, далее проверяются все возможные адреса коммутаторов и добавляются те, которые доступны на данный момент. Вся процедура на текущей сети ИНКО занимает около 2 минут из-за таймаутов ожидания недоступных коммутаторов. Вывод списка ip $ ./db.py list Выводит список всех ip адресов и общее количество записей в базе данных. Работа с конкретным ip $ ./db.py add IP $ ./db.py get IP $ ./db.py delete IP Добавление коммутатора в базу, просмотр информации из базы, удаление коммутатора. Поиск по базе $ ./db.py search STRING Выполняет поиск в названии модели или адресе установки коммутатора. wsgi.py  api модуль для работы с локальной базой данных    '/', GET - получение списка всех ip адресов коммутаторов из базы в формате json   '/', GET, POST, DELETE - просмотр, добавление, удаление коммутатора, никаких параметров передавать не нужно   Примеры использования Быстрое подключение к коммутаторам Добавляем простую функцию-алиас в .bashrc или .zshrc: tt () {     cur_dir=$(pwd)     cd ~/scripts-python     source .venv/bin/activate     python sw.py $@ connect     deactivate     cd $cur_dir } Подключаемся к коммуторам командой: $ tt 59.75 Вывод всех коммутаторов qtech $ ./db.py search qsw Отправка команд и вывод результата $ ./sw.py 59.75 send ""sh ports 1; conf ports 1 st d; sh ports 1; conf ports 1 st e"" $ ./sw.py 58.236 send ""sh run int eth 1/2; conf t; int eth 1/2; no shut; end; sh run int eth 1/2; conf t; int eth 1/2; shut;"" $ ./sw.py 59.75 send ""sh vlan dquote> create vlan 666 tag 666; conf vlan 66 add tag 1 dquote> sh vlan"" "

I made this chart as a tip for everyone who asks me, ""What should I learn next as a Python developer?""  Disclaimer  The purpose of this roadmap is to give you an idea about the landscape. The road map will guide you if you are confused about what to learn next, rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hype and trendy does not always mean best suited for the job.  Give a Star! ⭐ If you like or are using this project to learn or start your solution, please give it a star. Thanks!

Para sair, somente basta dar um CRTL+C em seu terminal. Apresentação da aplicação: Como boas práticas, o container somente deverá ser responsável por apenas um processo, para essa aplicação precisaremos de dois containers - um para rodar a aplicação e outro para o database - para isso utilizaremos o Docker-Compose Esse programa contém dois arquivos principais: app.py - um simples programa flask que se comunica com o database e expõe um endpoit e o init.sql - um script SQL que inicializa o database antes da criação do programa. Foi criado um Dockerfile para o app, que por consequência irá criar uma imagem e, por fim, um container - cuja descrição dos passos estão bem documentados no container em si - basicamente utilizaremos a imagem 3.6 do Python e expomos a porta 5000, copiamos os arquivos app.py e requirements.txt para um diretório utilizado em nossa aplicação e por fim a instalação dos pacotes necessários para sua utiização. O arquivo principal - docker-compose.yaml utiliza dos serviços: A app e o database MySQL. Os pontos chave desse arquivo são:  image: Representa uma imagem docker oficial existente do MySQL environment: É utilizada para adicionar variáveis de ambiente ports: Especifica as portas utilizadas - local e no container - escolhi essa porta alta para não ter conflito com alguma porta comum, eventualmente utilizada em sua máquina volumes: Como nós queremos que o container seja utilizado com nosso db, nós conectamos o diretório que contém o init.sql nesse container. O volume também é utilizado para persistir os dados, como você pode ver na Documentação oficial  Também conseguimos acessar o database diretamente de nosso terminal através do comando mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=32000 -u root -p

Based on this tutorial from Leodanis Pozo Ramos from Realpython  In the project’s root directory, you’ll find the following files:   README.md provides the project description and instructions on installing and running the application. Adding a descriptive and detailed README file to your projects is considered a best practice in programming, especially if you’re planning to release the project as an open source solution.   tree.py provides an entry-point script for you to run the application.   Then you have the rptree/ directory that holds a Python package with three modules:  rptree.py provides the application’s main functionalities. __init__.py enables rptree/ as a Python package. cli.py provides the command-line interface for the application.

This course uses a combo of visual, theoretical, and hands-on programming approaches to explain concepts in a fun and accessible way. It explains some of the most important data structures such as stacks, queues, and priority queues, and how these are used by search algorithms such as depth-first search, breadth-first search, and the A-star (A*) algorithm. Also shows how to trace the execution of algorithms.

Story Let's hang somebody! Implement the popular Hangman game. Tasks   Implement the play(word, lives) function as a basic hangman game.  The function uses the word parameter as the word to guess and the lives parameter as the number of available mistakes. The initial game state is displayed as _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (one underscore for each letter in word). The game state is displayed as _ o d _ _ o o _ if letters 'd' and 'o' are revealed. It is possible to make guesses, and letters that occur in the word are revealed. When a guessed letter does not occur in word, the player loses one life. When a guess is repeated (regardless of its occurrences), the player is notified, and nothing happens. When a guess is wrong (either a new or a repeated letter), the previous wrong letters are shown to the user. The player wins when all letters in word are revealed. The player loses when the number of wrong guesses is higher than the value of lives (not counting repeated guesses). When the player types 'quit' as input, the program says good-bye and terminates.    The game uses a random word from a pre-defined word collection.  The game randomly picks a word at each run. The game randomly picks a country from countries-and-capitals.txt.

These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.   0.6 Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number. Do this without using any builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.The function should expect a bunch of numbers, not an array or list.   0.6 Bonus how can you change the code so it can take in any number of numbers? Do this without using builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch. Again, the function should expect a bunch of numbers as input, not an array or list. Please do not write a whole new function. Upgrade your existing function.   0.7 Write a function that takes in a number representing the temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Write another function that does the opposite (Fahrenheit to Celsius).   0.8 Make a function to convert any number into hours and minutes. (For example, 71 will become “1 hour, 11 minutes; 133 will become “2 hours, 13 minutes.) Most people get this question wrong. Make sure you handle singulars and plurals for both hours and minutes.   0.9 Write a function that takes in a string and then prints out all the vowels in the string. Make sure it can deal with capital letters and small letters. For example, Input: ""Umuzi"", Output: Vowels: u, i.   0.10 Make a function that takes two strings as input, and outputs the common characters/letters that they share. (For example, Input: ‘house’, ‘computers’ . Output: ‘Common letters: o, u, e, s’).    Author : Kenneth MM "

Как создать свой репозиторий для выполнения заданий  Подробнее о работе с Git и Github в книге  Создание репозитория на GitHub Для создания своего репозитория на основе шаблона нужно:  залогиниться на GitHub открыть репозиторий с заданиями нажать ""Use this template"" и создать новый репозиторий на основе этого шаблона в открывшемся окне надо ввести название репозитория после этого готов новый репозиторий с копией всех файлов из исходного репозитория с заданиями   Клонирование репозитория с GitHub Для локальной работы с репозиторием его нужно клонировать. Для этого используется команда git clone: $ git clone git@github.com:natenka/pyneng-examples-exercises.git Cloning into 'pyneng-examples-exercises'... remote: Counting objects: 241, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (191/191), done. remote: Total 241 (delta 43), reused 239 (delta 41), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (241/241), 119.60 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (43/43), done. Checking connectivity... done.  По сравнению с приведённой в этом листинге командой, вам нужно изменить:  имя пользователя natenka на имя своего пользователя на GitHub; имя репозитория pyneng-examples-exercises на имя своего репозитория на GitHub.  В итоге, в текущем каталоге, в котором была выполнена команда git clone, появится каталог с именем репозитория, в моём случае – ""pyneng-examples-exercises"". В этом каталоге теперь находится содержимое репозитория на GitHub. Виртуалки Для курса подготовлены два варианта виртуальных машин: vmware и Vagrant. По ссылке есть инструкции для каждого варианта, а также инструкция по выполнению заданий на Windows:  https://pyneng.github.io/docs/course-vm/  Задания В каталоге exercises находятся задания к курсу, отсортированные по разделам курса. Кроме того, там находятся все вспомогательные файлы (конфигурации и др), которые используются в заданиях.  Если в заданиях раздела есть задания с буквами (например, 5.2a), то можно выполнить сначала задания без букв, а затем с буквами. Задания с буквами, как правило, немного сложнее заданий без букв и развивают/усложняют идею в соответствующем задании без буквы. Например, если в разделе есть задания: 5.1, 5.2, 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.3, 5.3a. Сначала, можно выполнить задания 5.1, 5.2, 5.3. А затем 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.3a. Однако, если задания с буквами получается сделать сразу, можно делать их по порядку.  Тесты Начиная с раздела «9. Функции» для проверки заданий есть автоматические тесты. Они помогают проверить все ли соответствует поставленной задаче, а также дают обратный отклик по тому, что не соответствует задаче. Как правило, после первого периода адаптации к тестам, становится проще делать задания с тестами.  Как работать с тестами и основы pytest  "

While they accept may different items, old vehicles are their most valuable, so they want to keep better track of all the different ones they have. Tasks  Allow for four different vehicle types (listed below) to be created and edited.  For each Vehicle type, only display the relevant fields to the user  For example: If a a Coupe is being created/edited, do not show the ""Automatic sliding doors"" field.   Use backend/src/database.py as a stubbed out database service to persist objects. It'll be wiped out each time you restart the backend, but should be sufficiet for our purposes.   After each vehicle is created, register it using the VehicleRegistrationService (at backend/src/vehicle_registration_service.py) and permanently associate that registration ID with the vehicle. List all vehicles on http://localhost:4200/vehicles with their type, nickname, mileage rating and registration ID  mileage rating is defined as:  low: mileage < 10,000 medium: 10,000 <= mileage < 100,000 high: 100,000 <= mileage      Vehicle Types  Sedan  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-4, default: 4 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Coupe  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-2, default: 2 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Mini-Van  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-4, default: 4  For each door: (Tip: Make sure everything else is working before addressing this)  Sliding: boolean, default: false     Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Motorcycle  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-2, default: 2 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works Seat status: works, fixable, junk, default: works    Guildelines Please don't spend more than two (2) hours on this project! The goal is not to add every bell, whistle, feature and optimization that you can think of. The goal is to both see an example of working code that you write and see how you do implementing realistic (albeit contrived...) features. You will be judged on how accurately you complete the above tasks and the quality of the code you write. The backend has some routes stubbed out and the frontend has been initialized via Create React App. You are free to make any and all changes you'd like to complete the assignment. Getting Started See SETUP.md for instructions on how to get your development envrionment working. If you have any questions, especially regarding setup, please contact us so we can get it sorted out ASAP! When you are finished, push all changes to the repo on GitHub and email us that you've finished! Feel free to to open a pull request or leave any other comments on specific commits or the repo as you see fit. Notes  If you have any issues at all, especially with getting your development environment working, please reach out to us ASAP. Our intention isn't to make you troubleshoot an existing project's configuration. (You wouldn't spend the majority of your work day doing that in real life). We are more than happy to do that for you! Make your first priority getting everything to work! Do not worry about server-side rendering of any JavaScript React components Add any additional Python pckages, npm modules or other tools you'd like  "

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It has been used in multiple fields and industries. For example, medical diagnosis, image processing, prediction, classification, learning association, regression etc. Machine Learning is divided into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Although it may seem that the first refers to prediction with human intervention and the second does not, these two concepts are more related with what we want to do with the data. Overview In this project we will apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We are going to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using the credit card dataset, we’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we'll use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once we’re done, we’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk. Below are the list of Deliverables:  Deliverable 1: Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk Deliverable 2: The SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk Deliverable 3: Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)  Analysis We will use jupypter notebook with python packages for our Analysis. In all the steps we will import the dependencies, define the columns, Load the data. Then we will create the training and testing variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the get_dummies() method. We can also create the target variables and check the balance of it using the below set of codes. Creating target variables  Split the Data into Training and Testing  The precision, recall scores and finally F1 score After the accuracy score and with Confusion matrix values we will create a classification report. Basically the below methods are used to calculate the Precision, Recall and F1 score (harmonic mean):     Deliverable 1: Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk With our knowledge of the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, we’ll evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, we’ll use the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and then we’ll use the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm. Using these algorithms, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report. Random Oversampling  SMOTE Oversampling  ClusterCentroids Undersampling  Deliverable 2: The SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk Using the SMOTEENN algorithm, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report. Combination (Over and Under) Sampling  Deliverable 3: Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk With our knowledge of the imblearn.ensemble library, we’ll train and compare two different ensemble classifiers, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate each model. Using both algorithms, we’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train the ensemble classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report. Balanced Random Forest Classifier  Feature importance in descending order  Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier  Results So, from our above six Machine Learning Models we can describe the balanced accuracy scores, the precision, recall scores and finally F1 score (harmonic mean). Below are the corresponding values for each Algorithms:  Summary From the above results and table of counts we can clearly see the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores and the F1 Score are high for Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier Machine learning algorithm. Also, the F1 score can be characterized as a single summary statistic of precision and sensitivity(recall) and it is a great measurement to gauge model performance. From the above table values the best performing model is the Easy Ensemble Classifier with an average F1 score of 0.96. While the worst performing is Cluster Centroid with an average F1 score of 0.60. So, we can apply this machine learning technique to solve a credit card risk in real-world.

This project is currently in a BETA STAGE. Installation You can install this package by running the following command in your terminal: pip install matchcaselib or update it with the command pip install --upgrade matchcaselib  Usage from matchcaselib import match  a = input(""Enter in a number: "") a = int(a) b = input(""Enter in another number: "") b = int(b)  with match(a, b) as m:   if(m.case(1, 1)):     print(""All ones."")   if(m.case(1, 2)):     print(""One and two."")   if(m.case(a, 1)):     print(""The value of A can be anything!  A was {} and b was 1."".format(a))   if(m.default):     print(""I don't know what you mean..."")  What you can do:  Compare as many sets of variables as you would like (the amount you provide with the initialization of the class must be consistent with the amount you use for the case method.) Make a ""default"" response - Run a block if default is true (no matches were found)  Work in Progress features:  Multi-pattern matching (test for multiple patterns) Break function - leave the current match  What not to do:  Use different amounts of variables for the class initialization and the use of the case method I don't know, there aren't many bugs right now LOL  "

Extractor de tweets La extracción de tweets se realiza con el script hateblockers_tweets_extractor.py. Para ejecutarlo es necesario en primer lugar crear un virtual environment con las dependencias del archivo requirements.txt. Puede accederse a la documentación para crear un virtual environment desde aquí. Para ejecutar el script hay que invocar desde consola el comando: python hateblockers_tweets_extractor.py  El script automáticamente buscará los términos existentes en el archivo terms_to_search.txt. Habrá de declararse un término por línea. Es necesario configurar el archivo .env con las siguientes variables:   API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET - Credenciales de twitter   EXPORT_LOG - Bool. Sirve para definir si queremos que se cree un log del proceso de extracción   LOG_FILE - String. Nombre del archivo donde se volcarán los datos del log.   OUTPUT_FILE - String. Nombre del archivo de salida donde se volcarán los tweets extraídos.   EXCLUDE_RETWEETS - Bool. Sirve para excluir los retweets de la extracción.

It can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving and calculate scores, if this score limit is high then the alarm will ring. Scope The scope of the Drowsy Driver Detection in the modern period is to diminish the vehicle street mishap and furthermore this project is utilized for security reasons for a driver as it reduces car accidents. The fatigue detection system in this project is capable of detecting drowsiness on drivers and then based on the current situation will alert the driver using an alarm. Problem statement Fatigue is a safety problem that has not yet been deeply tackled by any country in the world mainly because of its nature. Fatigue, in general, is very difficult to measure or observe unlike alcohol and drugs, which have clear key indicators and tests that are available easily. Probably, the best solutions to this problem are awareness about fatigue-related accidents and promoting drivers to admit fatigue when needed. The former is hard and much more expensive to achieve, and the latter is not possible without the former as driving for long hours is very lucrative. Technology used  Pyhton   Machine learning   Image processing   Some pyhton libraries used in this project are- numpy, keras, tensorflow, OpenCV, Pygame  Algorithm Step 1 – Take image as input from a camera. Step 2 – Detect the face in the image and create a Region of Interest (ROI). Step 3 – Detect the eyes from ROI and feed it to the classifier. Step 4 – Classifier will categorize whether eyes are open or closed. Step 5 – Calculate score to check whether the person is drowsy. Dataset The dataset used for this model is created by us. To create the dataset, we wrote a script that captures eyes from a camera and stores in our local disk. We separated them into their respective labels ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’. The data was manually cleaned by removing the unwanted images which were not necessary for building the model. Or, you can download the dataset from kaggle click here Screenshots Awaken and sleeping person  Flow chart  Contributing Pull requests are welcome.

This script is intended to allow for the control of a single unit over TCP/IP from the show control software QLab. However, it can also be run manually from a shell, where it should be cross-platform compatible. This script is written in python V2, as this the default version that ships with macOS. If you have a different version of python running on your mac or PC I believe it will still work, however, I haven't had the chance to test it. Input and output numbers are normalized by the script to allow for human numbering to be used. Usage All methods of use require the  placeholder to be changed for the IP address of the Smart Videohub unit. For example the line address = ""<IP ADDRESS>"" should read something like address = ""192.168.1.100"". Using the script from the command line called in the following way: python smarthubctl.py *input* *output* To allow the script to run from QLab, you need to call the python script from an AppleScript cue like so: 'do shell script ""python /path/to/script/smarthubctl.py *input* *output*""' More details can be found here https://blog.allaway.tech/qlab/controlling-blackmagic-design-smart-videohubs-from-qlab/ "

For example: a command-line command here Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations. Usage This Usage section would explain more about how to run the software, what kind of behavior to expect, and so on. Basic operation Begin with the simplest possible example of how to use your software.  Provide example command lines and/or screen images, as appropriate, to help readers understand how the software is expected to be used.  Many readers are likely to look for command lines they can copy-paste directly from your explanations, so it's best to keep that in mind as you write examples. Additional options Some projects need to communicate additional information to users and can benefit from additional sections in the README file.  It's difficult to give specific instructions – a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc.  Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining. Known issues and limitations In this section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software.  If none are known yet, this section can be omitted (and don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the Table of Contents too); alternatively, you can leave this section in and write something along the lines of ""none are known at this time"". Getting help Inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least how they can report problems they may encounter.  This may simply be a request to use the issue tracker on your repository, but many projects have associated chat or mailing lists, and this section is a good place to mention those. Contributing This section is optional; if your repository is for a project that accepts open-source contributions, then this section is where you can mention how people can offer contributions, and point them to your guidelines for contributing.  (If you delete this section, don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the Table of Contents too.)

417243570;filedep;https://github.com/flcong/filedep;Python;2021-10-14T18:36:41Z;0;0;0;"filedep: A small python tool to check file dependency Motivation When doing empirical analysis, you may encounter the following issue about file dependency.   Suppose code.py (or code.do, code.sas, code.m, code.R, etc) reads data from indata.csv, does some data cleaning, and then saves the intermediary data as outdata.csv.   After using outdata.csv to run some statistical tests, you want to change the data cleaning procedure a bit, so you modify code.py.   If there are only one code file and two data files, you will easily remember to re-run code.py to update the output data outdata.csv.   However, suppose that outdata.csv is then used by code2.py to write finaldata.csv. Then, people may easily forget to re-run code2.py as well to update finaldata.csv.   As a result, this may cause the illusion that results change after you run the same set of code twice. For example, you forget to update finaldata.csv initially, but then accidentally update finaldata.csv some time later. Then, you find that results change after you run the same set of code.   To resolve this issue, I build this simple package to check file dependencies based on last modified time. Users can define file dependencies, such as code.py using pre1.csv and pre2.csv as input to write post1.csv and post2.csv. Then, the function in the package will check if the last modified times of both pre1.csv and pre2.csv are before that of code.py and the last modified times of both post1.csv and post2.csv are after that of code.py. If any file dependency is broken, the broken ones will be printed or saved to a file. Installation Use pip to install the package as follows: pip install filedep Usage Import the package using import filedep The key function is check_dep(deps, outfile=sys.stdout, reterr=False). The first argument is a list of dependencies (defined below). The second argument specifies where to print error information if any file dependency is broken. The default is sys.stdout. The third argument specifies if broken dependencies are returned from the function. This is mainly for testing purposes. The default is False, i.e., broken dependencies are only printed. The file dependencies have to be provided by the user using the format defined below. In the template folder, there is a template to define dependencies and use check_dep() function to check. Example 1. No broken file dependencies The following code creates several empty files: import filedep import time import os from os.path import join as pj  PATH = r'C:\test_check_dep' if not os.path.exists(PATH):     os.mkdir(PATH)  def touch(filepath):     if os.path.exists(filepath):         os.utime(filepath)     else:         with open(filepath, 'a') as f:             pass  # Touch files in a specific order touch(pj(PATH, 'pre11.csv')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'pre12.csv')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'code1.py')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'post11.csv')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'post12.csv')) time.sleep(.1)  # Define dependencies deps = [     (         [             pj(PATH, 'pre11.csv'),             pj(PATH, 'pre12.csv')         ],          pj(PATH, 'code1.py'),          [             pj(PATH, 'post11.csv'),             pj(PATH, 'post12.csv'),         ],     ), ] filedep.check_dep(deps) In deps, we define a single dependency as follows: under the directory C:\test_check_dep, code1.py reads pre11.csv and pre12.csv to produce post11.csv and post12.csv. Then, the last modified times of both pre11.csv and pre12.csv must be before that of code1.py and those of both post11.csv and post12.csv must be after that of code1.py Since the dependency is satisfied by construction, the output is All file dependencies are verified!  Example 2. Broken file dependencies The following code creates several empty files and define two broken dependencies: import filedep import time import os from os.path import join as pj  PATH = r'C:\test_check_dep' if not os.path.exists(PATH):     os.mkdir(PATH)  def touch(filepath):     if os.path.exists(filepath):         os.utime(filepath)     else:         with open(filepath, 'a') as f:             pass  # Touch files in a specific order touch(pj(PATH, 'pre11.csv')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'pre12.csv')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'code1.py')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'post11.csv')) time.sleep(.1) # Note code1.py is newer than post11.csv touch(pj(PATH, 'code1.py')) time.sleep(.1) touch(pj(PATH, 'post12.csv')) time.sleep(.1)  # Define dependencies deps = [     (         [             pj(PATH, 'pre11.csv'),         ],          pj(PATH, 'code1.py'),          [             pj(PATH, 'post11.csv'),         ],     ),       (         [             pj(PATH, 'pre11.csv'),             pj(PATH, 'pre12.csv'),         ],          pj(PATH, 'code1.py'),          [             pj(PATH, 'post11.csv'),              pj(PATH, 'post12.csv'),         ],     ) ] filedep.check_dep(deps) Here, we define 2 dependencies. The second one is the same as that in the previous example, but the first one defines a simpler dependency: code1.py uses pre11.csv to produce post11.csv. Since by construction post11.csv is ""touched"" before code1.py, both dependencies are broken. Hence, the output is There are 2 broken file dependencies!!!  [1]                                            Last Modified Time   Input:     C:\test_check_dep\pre11.csv      : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.011976   Code:     C:\test_check_dep\code1.py       : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.451668   Output:     C:\test_check_dep\post11.csv     : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.342247 [2]                                            Last Modified Time   Input:     C:\test_check_dep\pre11.csv      : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.011976     C:\test_check_dep\pre12.csv      : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.125543   Code:     C:\test_check_dep\code1.py       : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.451668   Output:     C:\test_check_dep\post11.csv     : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.342247     C:\test_check_dep\post12.csv     : 2021-10-14 14:25:11.559796  where the last modified date of each file in each broken dependency is shown. Format of file dependency The first argument of check_dep() is a list of dependencies. Its format should be as follows:  It is a list of tuples. Each tuple has three elements.  The first element is a list of str. The second element is a str. The third element is a list of str. Each str is an absolute path of a existing file.    As an example, the following code defines two dependencies: deps = [     (         ['pre1.txt'], 'code1.py', ['post1.txt']     ),     (         ['pre21.txt', 'pre22.txt'], 'code2.py', ['post21.txt', 'post22.txt']     ) ]  The first one says that code1.py uses pre1.txt as input and outputs post1.txt. As a result, the last modified date of the three files should satisfy pre1.txt<=code1.py<=post1.txt. The second one says that code2.py uses pre21.txt and pre22.txt as input and outputs post21.txt and post22.txt. As a result, the last modified date of the three files should satisfy max(pre21.txt,pre22.txt)<=code1.py<=min(post21.txt,post22.txt) where max (min) represent the maximum (minimum) date.  "

A good trap should have a high likelihood that the next move in sequence is commonly chosen. 😵 Potency How likely is the player to lose after they have fallen into the trap? A good trap should be deadly once your opponent has fallen into it!  🎯 Trap score The trap score for a given pgn input is the product of these two scores. For more information, see the accompanying blog post. Have fun!  Getting Started To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. Installation  Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/davidADSP/chess-trap-scorer.git cd chess-trap-scorer  Pip install requirements (inside a virtual environment) pip install -r requirements.txt   Quickstart To score a given opening, simply use the following command, with the pgn of your choice. python3 solver.py --pgn '1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nc6 4. Nxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bc5 6. Bg5' The lichess opening API is used to gather data for the analysis. No token is required. The config.py file allows you to change the variant, speeds and rating range of the analysis, as well as the number of moves to search over to find the best follow up move and the alpha of the potency confidence interval. Output The output is the following summary (shown here with descriptive labels): Black to play <- The colour of the player who will take advantage of the trap Total moves:	 6 <- Number of moves played by the opponent 	e4:	        64.02% <- The likelihood that the opponent plays this required move 	Nf3:	    66.17% 	Nxe5:	    34.16% 	Nxc6:	    84.17% 	d3:	        38.70% 	Bg5:	    14.63% Likelihood:	    0.69% <- The product of the likelihoods Frequency:	    Every 145 games <- 1 / likelihood Av Move Prob:   43.63% <- Geometric mean of the move probabilities  Continuation:	Nxe4 <- Best move that takes advantage of the trap Total games:	1670 <- Number of lichess games where this move has been played Shock:		    +43.21% (52.42% -> 95.63%) <- The delta of the win likelihood before and after this move Potency:	    95.63% CI ['94.65%', '96.61%'] (95%) <- The % chance of winning after this move with confdience interval  Trap Score:		    41.72% ( = 43.63% * 95.63% ) <- the product of the Av Move Prob and Potency  The higher the trap score, the better the trap!

We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal! Objectives For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field. Please, don't remove the r character at the start of the code template. It's a part of the string and it's important. So, the string should start with r"""""" sequence. This “r” at the beginning stands for “raw” and allows various characters to be used in a string without escaping. For instance, “\” in a non-raw string should be escaped as follows: “\”. Stage 2 (current): Description Now it's time to make our project user-friendly. In this final stage, you'll make your software ready for the zoo staff to use. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted. Objectives Your tasks at this point: Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop. Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting exit should end the program. When the program is done running, it should print: See you later! "

Based on a open source dataset which contains user- and expert reviews, genres, gaming platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data up to 2016 a extensive data analysis should be carried out in preparation for the campaign for 2017. For this campaign patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not should be identified, which will allow ice to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. Project Steps  Within this project the data has been preprocessed:  Filling missing values Cathegorizing Adjusting datatypes Dropping unusable rows   An analysis has been carried out:  Investigating the platfroms lifespan, behaviour over time, How different markets influence sales and genre sbstitution The influence of different genres on sales The influence of age ratings on sales The influence of user and professional ratings on total sales How different platforms and ratings as well as their distribution differs    Outcomes For the campaign for 2017 we recommend to start a campaign which full fills the following criteria:  Platform: PS4 (PC and XOne can also be considered) genre: Action, shoter or sport Both ratings (professional and user) should be collected for (if done) beta testing Age rating: M But beside of thos factors, it should maybe considered to develop a campagin for a game for the next generation of consoles (PS5 / Xbox X) because the newest verions are aleady 4-5 Years on the market and already crossed their top of sales (at least if the trend is continuing as expected and there is nothing in the data what shows the opposite)  Maybe it would also be interessting to investigate mobile games which basically killed the handheld platforms around 2010 (except 3DS)

To find patterns and preferences in the passengers behaviour and the impact of external factors the company provided data in a database containing info on taxi rides in Chicago. Data aggregation In order to select and use the necessary data a SQL query has been developed and executed. Additional to the provided data, the weather data of given time period has been scraped. To enable an in-depth understanding of the cab rides and the high variance in rides per company the public available datasets for medallion owners in Chicago has been downloaded via the API on the website of the city. Conclusion The following steps have been performed within the project:  Data mining, aggregation and merging Data preprocessing Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis  Observations within the project:  There are two different types of cab drivers: affiliations and independent drivers. The percentage of surrendered independent cab drivers since 2017 is pretty high. Therefore the Zuber needs to pay attention to bind their drivers pretty well The amount of rides to the city centre is significant higher than to the outer districts The weather does not influence the routes from the city center to the airport drastically, but for the rest of the destinations, the weather has an impact. (bad weather leads to an increase in rides) The duration of the trips from the airport to the city centre differs. This can be explained by the general increased use of cars due to bad weather and consequentially fuller streets.

417268326;customer_segmentation_package;https://github.com/rbuerki/customer_segmentation_package;;2021-10-14T20:08:38Z;0;0;0;"xxx Segments This is a python package designed for the monthly calculation / update of the different segmentation models for xxx loyalty members:  RFM scorings and segment calculation Affinties clustering Lifecycle segmentation  The aim of the package is to perform all of these calculations in one run and based on the same source data so that there are no inconsistencies resulting from different data loads, source tables etc. The results are written to a local CSV file and to a table in the analytics DB. Build This package requires Python 3.6 or higher. It runs in the ""xxx_segments"" conda environment which can be installed according to the env.yml file. (It is worth to note that sk-learn has been fixed to version 0.21.2 because of a pickled clustering model that was developed with this version.) Run In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (the one that contains this README). Launch with: python xxx_segments To speed up the process during development and testing two CLI options can be passed to the run command:  -p / --preloaded : Skips the stored procedure execution for loading the transaction data and thus fetches preloaded transaction data from the analytics DB. This is handy if you make changes to the code only. -n / --nowriteback : Skips the final insertion of the results into the database. They are still stored to a CSV file tough. This allows for experimentation without overwriting existing results.  Output The script results in a pandas DataFrame consisting of a row for every xxx loyalty member (identified by MemberAK and MemberSK) with the different metrics and segment scorings. These are:    ""yearmon"" ""MemberAK"" ""MemberSK"" ""recency"" ""frequency"" ""monetary"" ""RFM-Score"" ""RFM_3"" ""RFM_Segment"" ""Affinität_Segment"" ""Lifecycle_Segment"" ""R"" ""F"" ""M""     ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...     yearmon A 4 digit int (yymm) indicating the final month of the period the actual results were updated for.* recency: Number of days since last purchase (up to 3 years back) frequency: Number of days with a transaction within the last 1 year monetary: Sum of turnover within last 2 years rfm_score: 3 digit RFM-Score according to ""PKZ-Logic"" rfm_3: ""Classic"" 3 digit RFM-Score consisting of concatentated R-F-M quantile classifications rfm_segment: RFM-segment classification (based on ""rfm_3"") cluster_name: Segment classification based on products purchased lifecycle_segment: Segment classification on temporal components and frequencies  *The reference date / end date for all calculations is always the last day of the last full month for which transaction data has been loaded. Upsert / Merge into DB These results are merged into a DB-table containing the results of all past runs / months. The yearmon column together with the MemberAK form a composite primary key. See the table create statement for the details and exact column structure: CREATE TABLE xxx_analytics.dbo.xxx_segments_hist (   yearmon smallint,   MemberAK int,   MemberSK int NOT NULL,   recency smallint,   frequency smallint,   monetary money,   R tinyint,   F tinyint,   M tinyint,   RFM-Score smallint,   RFM_3 smallint,   RFM_Segment nvarchar(30),   Affnität_Segment nvarchar(40),   Lifecycle_Segment nvarchar(30),   PRIMARY KEY (yearmon, MemberAK) ) The merge logic is as follows:  INSERT rows if the primary key does not yet exist (appends results for the first run of a new month to the table) UPDATE row entries if the primary key already exists (for example if you rerun the script for a given month, it updates the scores that have changed)  Backfills: This logic makes it possible to ""backfill"" results for earlier periods by running the script with past transaction data. But one has to be aware that the loyality member pool and the contents of the helper tables in the analytics DB (on Warengruppen and Sites) will be loaded with actual values. (This means for example that more recently created members will be considered for modelling and will be classified as ""lost inactive"" for earlier periods.) (Actual work-around for backfills: Use the stored procedure ""manual date"" and set the dates manually in the transaction query.) Save ""Export-File"" to CSV A subset of the result columns is also written to a CSV file in the local data/EXPORT/ folder (or whatever SAVE_PATH is defined in the settings.py). The file name includes a 4-digit yearmon code and a timestamp. These files are meant for iLoy to import the CRM-scores into the PROD DB. This CSV has the following columns:    ""MemberAK"" ""MemberSK"" ""R"" ""F"" ""M"" ""RFM-Score"" ""RFM_3"" ""RFM_Segment"" ""Affinität_Segment"" ""Lifecycle_Segment""     ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

Uncomment this line if the server is running locally //var endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/check'; var endpoint = null;  var level = 'toa' // or 'sr' var start = '2021-09-15' var end = '2021-09-21' var check = new checker.Checker(geometry, level, start, end, endpoint);  print(ui.Label('CHECK', null, check.url())) If you hit an error that says:  Application error: An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. You can do this from the Heroku CLI with the command  is because you are asking too much, to solve it decrease the area of the geometry or the time window. Alternative 2 (with python) If you run the server locally you can fetch more data, so you won't hit the Application error. Also, you can modify the code to your needs and even contribute to this project to make it better for everyone. Steps:  Clone this repository Create a virtual environment (for example: s2checker) Activate the environment Navigate to the repository folder Install dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt   Create a new file in the repo folder called .env (text file) Add the following to that file:  FLASK_ENV=development HUB_USER=your_copernicus_hub_user HUB_PASS=your_copernicus_hub_password   Run the server:  flask run   The server is running, now you can uncomment the endpoint line in the code editor code  "

And how should they respond to those memes? These are the two research questions that I have chosen for my bachelor's degree thesis. To perform this research, I have used the PushShift API to develop a dataset of 17,000 brand memes retrieved from Reddit. The images have then been processed using OCR; in this way, I was able to convert the in-image text of each meme into a string. To identify consumer opinions, a topic extraction model has been developed based on these strings. In this GitHub page it is shown the whole Python code developed for this project.  ITA: In che modo le aziende possono analizzare i meme di Internet per identificare critiche e complimenti su prodotti e servizi? E come dovrebbero rispondere a questi meme? Queste sono le due research questions che ho scelto per la mia tesi di laurea. Per eseguire questa ricerca, ho utilizzato l'API PushShift per sviluppare un dataset di 17.000 meme recuperati da Reddit. Le immagini sono state poi elaborate tramite OCR; in questo modo, sono stato in grado di convertire il testo nell'immagine di ciascun meme in una stringa. Per identificare le opinioni dei consumatori, è stato sviluppato un modello di Topic Extraction basato su queste stringhe. In questa pagina di GitHub viene mostrato l'intero codice Python sviluppato per questo progetto. "

Após isso, abra o Google Colab e faça upload do Notebook pybr21.ipynb, executando as células uma de cada vez e sequencialmente. O programa irá gerar um arquivo chamado arquivos/selected.txt, contendo as ações selecionadas para cada dia, o qual será utilizado pelo Algoritmo Genético para otimizar as proporçoes. Após a otimização, o gráfico de desempenho das carteiras/portfólios estará disponívem em graficos/return.png, e as carteiras selecionadas para cada dia e para cada execução estarão no arquivo final.txt. Neste repositório existem links para apresentação e slides ensinando como funciona o Aprendizado de Máquina utilizado para predição de preços de ações, caso tenha interesse em se aprofundar no assunto.

The assignments will be useful even if you are reading another Python book. All tasks are focused on network topics.  Links  Working environment Testing tasks with the pyneng utility  How to create your own repository for tasks  Git/Github basics  Creating a repository on GitHub To create your own repository based on a template, you need:  open tasks repo above the file list, click Use this template type a name for your repository click Create repository from template now you have a new repository with the same directory structure and files as pyneng-examples-exercises-en   Clone repository To work locally with the repository, you need to clone it. To do this, use the git clone command: $ git clone git@github.com:natenka/my_tasks.git Cloning into 'my_tasks'... remote: Counting objects: 241, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (191/191), done. remote: Total 241 (delta 43), reused 239 (delta 41), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (241/241), 119.60 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (43/43), done. Checking connectivity... done.  In the command output above, you need to change:  username natenka to your username on GitHub repository name my_tasks to the name of your repository  As a result, in the current directory where the git clone command was executed, a directory with the name of the repository will appear, in my case - ""my_tasks"". This directory now contains local copy of the repository with tasks. Tasks (exercises) The exercises directory contains tasks with numbers corresponding to the sections of the book. In addition, there are all additional files (configurations, etc.) that are used in tasks. Tests Starting from section “4. Data types in Python ”there are automated tests for testing tasks. They help to check whether everything matches the task, and also give feedback on what does not correspond to the task. As a rule, after the first period of adaptation to tests, it becomes easier to do tasks with tests. Testing is done using the pyneng utility. Learn more about how to work with the pyneng utility. "

See also  Flask-Project-Template for a full feature Flask project including database, API, admin interface, etc. FastAPI-Project-Template The base to start an openapi project featuring: SQLModel, Typer, FastAPI, JWT Token Auth, Interactive Shell, Management Commands.  HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE  DO NOT FORK this is meant to be used from Use this template feature.   Click on Use this template Give a name to your project (e.g. my_awesome_project recommendation is to use all lowercase and underscores separation for repo names.) Wait until the first run of CI finishes (Github Actions will process the template and commit to your new repo) If you want codecov Reports and Automatic Release to PyPI On the new repository settings->secrets add your PIPY_API_TOKEN and CODECOV_TOKEN (get the tokens on respective websites) Read the file CONTRIBUTING.md Then clone your new project and happy coding!   NOTE: WAIT until first CI run on github actions before cloning your new project.  What is included on this template?  🖼️ Templates for starting multiple application types:  Basic low dependency Python program (default) use this template Flask with database, admin interface, restapi and authentication use this template. or Run make init after cloning to generate a new project based on a template.   📦 A basic setup.py file to provide installation, packaging and distribution for your project. Template uses setuptools because it's the de-facto standard for Python packages, you can run make switch-to-poetry later if you want. 🤖 A Makefile with the most useful commands to install, test, lint, format and release your project. 📃 Documentation structure using mkdocs 💬 Auto generation of change log using gitchangelog to keep a HISTORY.md file automatically based on your commit history on every release. 🐋 A simple Containerfile to build a container image for your project. Containerfile is a more open standard for building container images than Dockerfile, you can use buildah or docker with this file. 🧪 Testing structure using pytest ✅ Code linting using flake8 📊 Code coverage reports using codecov 🛳️ Automatic release to PyPI using twine and github actions. 🎯 Entry points to execute your program using python -m <python_test> or $ python_test with basic CLI argument parsing. 🔄 Continuous integration using Github Actions with jobs to lint, test and release your project on Linux, Mac and Windows environments.

The aim is the keep things as light as possible, and use feedback from the users to iterate.   Getting Started This project uses the following technologies:   Python v3.x+   Flask Whereas Django does a lot of things for us out of the box, Flask allows us to add only what we need.   Virtual environment This ensures you'll be able to install the correct packages without interfering with Python on your machine. Before you begin, please ensure you have this installed globally.     Installation   After cloning, change into the directory and type virtualenv .. This will then set up a a virtual python environment within that directory.   Next, type source bin/activate. You should see that your command prompt has changed to the name of the folder. This means that you can install packages in here without affecting affecting files outside. To deactivate, type deactivate   Rather than hunting around for the packages you need, you can install in one step. Type pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all the packages listed in the respective file. If you install a package, make sure others know by updating the requirements.txt file. An easy way to do this is pip freeze > requirements.txt   Flask requires that you set an environmental variable to the python file. However you do that, you'll want to set the file to be server.py. Check here for more details   You should now be ready to test the application. In the directory, type either flask run or python -m flask run. The app should respond with an address you should be able to go to using your browser.     Current Setup The app is powered by JSON files. This is to get around having a DB until we actually need one. The main ones are:  competitions.json - list of competitions clubs.json - list of clubs with relevant information. You can look here to see what email addresses the app will accept for login.    Testing You are free to use whatever testing framework you like-the main thing is that you can show what tests you are using. We also like to show how well we're testing, so there's a module called coverage you should add to your project.

This project will only focus on a small Generalized Linear Model (GLM); namely, the relationship between wage levels, the level of education and gender but the class below can also handle more complex models. Firstly, the methodology used to access and analyse the data will be outlined. The results of the analysis will then be discussed. Finally, a brief summary of the finding will be provided and ideas for future analysis discussed. Class: The class 'CPSAnalysis'is designed to allow quick access and analysis of the Current Population Survey (CPS) data. The class includes (as a default) a number variables; however, the variables can be changed, if required. The class also includes multiple methods that allow the user to plot a histogram and boxplot, fit a model, analyse the residuals of the model and show predictions. "

When its done, event loop wil pick up the event Blocking Call : A function that takes a long time to complete  Analogy: Synchronous: Cook rice then cook meat Asynchronous: Cook rice in the background, and cook meat. Check to see if rice is done  The general idea is that we have a bunch of functions that take a long time to complete. We want to run these functions in the background.  We define the functions as async functions. We can combine these functions into a task and add them to the event loop. We await the functions to complete. We run the functions in the background by using the event loop.

创建聊天室 room = ChatRoom.Room()  # 创建两个用户 user_1 = ChatRoom.User(""Foo"") user_1.default_callback() user_2 = ChatRoom.User(""Bar"") user_2.default_callback()  # 需要等待Room调度连接后, 才可以互相发送消息 user_1.user.Bar.send(""Hello!"") user_2.user.Foo.send(""Hello!"")  # 互相收到消息 >> 2021-10-15 10:15:04 Bar recv: ['Foo', 'Hello!'] >> 2021-10-15 10:15:04 Foo recv: ['Bar', 'Hello!']  ChatRoom 自动处理了很多网络配置中需要提供的复杂参数，ChatRoom 也解决了许多在网络传输中会遇到的麻烦问题.  高层对象：ChatRoom 是通过网络来传输 Python 数据对象，所以只有需要使用网络传输的情况使用 ChatRoom 才是合适的； 安全高效：传输层使用 TCP 协议，保证数据传输可靠，会话层使用了双端非对称加密保证数据传输的安全性，密码保存使用了 bcrypt 算法，保证用户密码不泄露； 全自动化：ChatRoom 的优势在于无论客户端主机是局域网机器，公网机器，还是不同内网环境的机器，都会由 Room 自动调度后分配集群的最高效连接方式； 逻辑隔离：ChatRoom 让用户专注与程序逻辑处理，而不用考虑物理机的网络配置，大多数的情况下只需几个参数就可以让集群互相连接起来；  ChatRoom 包含 Room 和 User 类、底层的 Server 和 Client 类、一个生成用户HASH密码的函数 hash_encryption import ChatRoom  ChatRoom.Room ChatRoom.User  ChatRoom.Server ChatRoom.Client  ChatRoom.hash_encryption  ChatRoom 的连接方式  局域网内互相连接：只要两个 User 处于同一局域网内，那么他们会直接局域网内连接； 具有公网IP的 User：在不满足 1 的情况下，其他机器都会使用公网IP进行连接； 中继连接：1 和 2 都不满足的情况下，相当于 User 被网络隔绝了，那么会通过 Room 进行数据转发；  Room Room 是 ChatRoom 的核心，所有的 User 的行为都是由 Room 来进行调度，可以把 Room 理解为一个小型的服务端，所有的 User 都会与 Room 连接. 当 User 与 Room 断开连接后，除了中继连接会断开，其他的连接方式不受影响，等待 Room 恢复后，所有的 User 会与 Room 再次建立连接. 在开始运行集群前，需要先把 Room 运行起来！ import ChatRoom  #

HacktoberFest Hello World in every other language ever. Just fork it and add a 'Hello World' program to contribute for hacktober fest and send a Pull Request!!  Get yourself free goodies by just writing a hello world! Say hi to the world in any language of your choice! What is Hacktoberfest? Hacktoberfest is a program by Digital Ocean, DEV and Github, where you can easily win a T-Shirt just by making 4 pull requests in the month of October to any open source projects on Github. Steps to follow 📜 1. Register for Hacktoberfest https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ 2. Fork it 🍴 You can get your own fork/copy of Hacktoberfest by using the Fork button.  3. Add a Program in any Language you like 🐇 Once you have forked the repo, add your progam in the language folder in main branch, if there is no language folder, make one, then add into it. You can take a look to the Programming Language List in Wikipedia to create a new one for Hacktoberfest! 4. Ready, Steady, Go... 🐢 🐇 Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our Help Wanted issues and creating pull requests. 5. Give this Project a Star ⭐ If you liked working on this repo, please share this repo as much as you can and star this repo to help as many people in opensource as you can. Steps to Make Changes and contribute using GIT! To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window. We’ll use the git clone command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository. This URL will be similar to the URL above, except now it will end with .git . In the cloud_haiku example above, the URL will look like this: https://github.com/your-username/Hacktoberfest.git You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green “Clone or download” button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you’ll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL: Once we have the URL, we’re ready to clone the repository. To do this, we’ll combine the git clone command with the repository URL from the command line in a terminal window: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hacktoberfest.git 4. Create a New Branch To create your branch, from your terminal window, change your directory so that you are working in the directory of the repository. Be sure to use the actual name of the repository (i.e. Hacktoberfest) to change into that directory. cd Hacktoberfest Now, we’ll create our new branch with the git branch command. Make sure you name it descriptively so that others working on the project understand what you are working on. git branch new-branch Now that our new branch is created, we can switch to make sure that we are working on that branch by using the git checkout command: git checkout new-branch Once you enter the git checkout command, you will receive the following output: Output: Switched to branch 'new-branch' At this point, you can now modify existing files or add new files to the project on your own branch. Make Changes Locally Once you have modified existing files or added new files to the project, you can add them to your local repository, which you can do with the git add command. Let’s add the -A flag to add all changes that we have made: git add -A or git add . Next, we’ll want to record the changes that we made to the repository with the git commit command. The commit message is an important aspect of your code contribution; it helps the other contributors fully understand the change you have made, why you made it, and how significant it is. Additionally, commit messages provide a historical record of the changes for the project at large, helping future contributors along the way. If you have a very short message, you can record that with the -m flag and the message in quotes: Example: git commit -m ""Updated Readme.md"" At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository: Example: git push --set-upstream origin new-branch 5. Update Local Repository While you are working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project as you don’t want to make a pull request for code that will cause conflicts. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you’ll need to sync changes. We’ll first go over configuring a remote for the fork, then syncing the fork. 6. Configure a Remote for the Fork Next, you’ll have to specify a new remote upstream repository for us to sync with the fork. This will be the original repository that you forked from. You’ll have to do this with the git remote add command. git remote add upstream https://github.com/Kronos-2701/Hacktoberfest.git In this example, upstream is the shortname we have supplied for the remote repository since in terms of Git, “upstream” refers to the repository that you cloned from. If you want to add a remote pointer to the repository of a collaborator, you may want to provide that collaborator’s username or a shortened nickname for the shortname.  Sync the Fork Once you have configured a remote that references the upstream and original repository on GitHub, you are ready to sync your fork of the repository to keep it up-to-date.  To sync your fork, from the directory of your local repository in a terminal window, you’ll have to use the git fetch command to fetch the branches along with their respective commits from the upstream repository. Since you used the shortname “upstream” to refer to the upstream repository, you’ll have to pass that to the command: git fetch upstream Switch to the local master branch of our repository: git checkout master You’ll now have to merge any changes that were made in the original repository’s master branch, that you will access through your local upstream/master branch, with your local master branch: git merge upstream/master 8. Create Pull Request At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository. You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the “New pull request” button on your left-hand side of the page. Hurray!! You just got closer to complete your hacktoberfest challenge.

Set “delayTime” and “audioToTextDelay” according to your internet speed. Pretty much set values work for all. The rest of the code is not to be altered.  Working of the script  When the script runs, it checks the I’m not a robot field. And a popup is visible(as usual) After that the script selects the audio button at bottom left. After that the script downloads the audio. into the same director with the name of “1.mp3”. it takes few seconds don’t worry. After that new tab is opened in to the browser which goes to the watson speech to text converter and uploads the file. And the audio file is converted into text as you can see. It copies the text and paste it into textfield. And the script then presses the verify button. Here you go… Problem Solved.  License This project is licensed under MIT License.

I will show you how to do it. #Firstly, install virtualenv package  $ pip3 install virtualenv  $ cd ./#directory you wanna implement  #Build virtualenv  $ virtualenv venv  #Activate it  $ source venv/bin/activate  # Deactivate  $ deactivate  How it works  When you implement virtualenv command, python env would be copied from #sys path to ./dir.  When you source it, the pointer pointed to sys-env python & pip would point to ./dir.

Its currently tested to work on Linux. Would be nice if you would test it on other OS and tell than on issues. Thanks :D Setup You must have python installed i am not covering it  git clone https://github.com/korrykatti/LOL.git cd LOL open terminal/cmd pip install -r requirements.txt This may take some time python3 lol.py  And Booyah! The app has started How to use  go to the folder of the script Paste/Make your .txt file to be readed to you ( more file type support in testing ) open terminal and python3 lol.py Just give the filename and enjoy listening If you want to change the accent just go to lol.py and in line engine.setProperty('voice', voices[11].id) change 11 to the voice index in your system If you want to slow down or fast the speech go to engine.setProperty('rate', 160) and replace 160 with whatever wpm you want  We now have PDF file support for that just run python3 pdfreader.py NOTE : Reading and speaking the pdf files is dependent on your system specs. For a pentium with 1 gb ram it takes 25 minutes to open a 40 page pdf. also the pdf must be in same folder. Pull request will be accepted if you find a faster method THANKS

417324994;ti-basic;https://github.com/eaglerock1337/ti-basic;;2021-10-15T00:46:10Z;0;0;0;ti-basic A collection of programs written in TI-Basic and Python for TI calculators. about This is my repository of TI-Basic programs for my TI Calculators. Presently, I own a TI-83 and a TI-89, both of which I have recently rediscovered. My TI-83 was fortunate enough to have a working backup battery, which allowed me to recover all my programs that I wrote in high school, which are located in ti-83/classic. Unfortunately, My TI-89 programs were lost. My goals are to translate these programs (at least Lightsabers! and Stocks 2000) to work on the TI-89 (as I was starting to do back in high school), as well as create remastered versions of these programs by optimizing and bugfixing my old code. As far as new goals, I am looking to replace my TI-83 (which has a broken data port) with a new TI-84 CE Python, which I'm hoping to port my games over to as well. I anticipate the most extensive versions of my games to be written on the TI-84 CE Python, once I have fixed themm for the TI-83 and TI-89.

Contents  Feature Highlights Requirements / Installation / Operation Defaults Management Filename Convention Note on Low Beam Angle Availability Data Origin Viewing the Files Roadmap Credits / Copyright  Feauture Highlights  Rapidly retrieve the most-recent Level-3 Radar Data Access to radar data for over 200 weather radars (159 WSR-88D; 45 TDWR), primarily found in the contiguous United States. Over 120 products are made accessible to download, with 112 being available for all WSR-88D Sites.  Many of these products are very similar, and just differ by scan angle   Maintain a ""Favorites"" radar site-list. This will streamline retrieval for your most-frequently accessed sites. Change the default (think 'start-up' or 'Home') radar site. Keeps track of the downloaded files, and indicates previous download of a file through changing the background color (but it does not prevent one from downloading again)  This download history can be deleted via the File, Options Menu. As typical products hold no more that 1 or 2 days worth of products, this should be done regularly    ⇧ back to Contents Requirements / Installation / Operation Requirements  Python (v3.5 or newer) Tkinter must be installed with Python  Installation  Simply download level3_radar_downloader_tk.pyz Place it into its own folder Run it. That's it!  Operation * For Convenience, these same instructions can be found within the Instructions / Overview option in the Help menu.  Select the radar site of interest, either from your favorites or the full list. Select the category. Select the product desired.  ** The radar site, category and product lists respond to arrow keys for movement; no need to press Enter/Return afterward.  Click Refresh URL List. (Shortcut Key: R)  Previously downloaded files will be highlighted in green. But the program does not prevent the user from downloading it again. It's there as a visual assist. A label above the clock will appear.  This label refers to the data in the URL box only. It does not reflect the currently-selected radar site or product. So even if you browse through the sites and products, it won't affect the URL List until you reload URLs via this button     Select the items you want to download. Click Get Selected URL(s). (Shortcut Key: U)   Items will be downloaded into corresponding folders based on their AWIPS Code (i.e. N0Q, N0U, etc).  ⇧ back to Contents Defaults Management  It is recommended to save your most-frequently used radar sites and use a default radar site. These features make accessing those sites much faster. Modifying the defaults can happen in two places within the app:  via Context Menu via options Menu   Your default settings will load upon every use of the app! Context Menu  Right-click on any site of interest and a context menu will appear, giving a description of the site (so you don't accidentally operate on the wrong one) From the Favorites context menu, only a removal option will be given. If changing the default site, a confirmation dialog will appear first.   Options Menu  Click File > Options. A menu will appear with essentially the same options as the context-menus, with an additional command to clear your favorites.    ⇧ back to Contents Filename Convention Upon retrieving a list of contained URL's, you'll notice a common, but confusing, file-name structure.  They'll be listed as an iteration of sn.NNNN where NNNN is typically a number between 0 and 300.  i.e. sn.0030, sn.0201, sn.last   These are the actual files which will be downloaded. To assist you, associated dates/times with those files will be listed. Natively, though they follow an iterative pattern, files higher in the sequence does not mean it is a newer file. There isn't any guaranteed order by filename. So the app does this for you. The results are re-sorted to display in time-descending order (newest to oldest). Upon downloading (but prior to saving), the data within the file is inspected to retrieve the proper WMO Header and Volume Time-Stamp. The file is then saved with a readable filename:  SSSS_WMOHDR_AAACCC_YYYYMMDDHHMM  SSSS is the radar's parent's Weather Forecast Office (WFO) callsign (i.e. KRNK) WMOHDR is the WMO Header (i.e. SDUS51) AAA is the AWIPS product code  Examples  N0Q is 0.5deg Base Reflectivity N0U is 0.5deg Base Velocity EET is Enhanced Echo Tops     CCC is the radar callsign (i.e. FCX) YYYYMMDDHHMM is the date-string, comprising of the Year, Month, Day, Hour, and Minute.   Example saved file name: KRNK_SDUS51_N0QFCX_202110090426 This file name structure is the formal standard, as far as I know. It's probably associated with the NEXRAD Information Dissemination Service (NIDS). I can't find any documentation to back that up though.    ⇧ back to Contents Note on Low Beam Angle Availability Most categories feature products of low beam angles.  NX_ products have a -0.2° angle NY_ products have a 0° angle; NZ_ products have a 0.3° angle  For a significant majority of WSR-88D sites, these products are not currently available. As such, the standard 0.5° angle product (N0_) will be auto-selected for categories supporting these low-beam products. ⇧ back to Contents Data Origin  The data comes from the Radar Product Central Collection Dissemination Service (RPCCDS) on the NWS Telecommunication Gateway.  In particular, the radar data is contained within the folder of https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/SL.us008001/DF.of/DC.radar/   This page is a great resource in explaining the folder structure of the data and interpretation of the products that are stored there:  https://www.weather.gov/tg/radfiles  Of note, this page is slightly outdated, as a lot of the legacy radar products (lower-quality, in general) are no longer maintained.     This PDF was referenced to assist in compiling the needed codes and descriptions:  https://www.weather.gov/media/tg/rpccds_radar_products.pdf   In general, you can expect the 300-or-so most-recent radar outputs available for each product.  ⇧ back to Contents Viewing the Files You'll need some other software for viewing or working with the files. Below are just a few options  NOAA's Weather Climate Toolkit (WCT) Unidata Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) McIDAS-V  ⇧ back to Contents Roadmap   Better management of download history by removing from the history files that aren't part of the most-recent data any longer  Comment the Python code (even though the general accessibility is that of an app, not .py files)  Investigate if a small image of radar imagery can appear to give reference to the file being inquired about  ⇧ back to Contents Credits / Copyright  Level 3 Radar Downloader Tk, © 2021, Kyle S.

Feel free to consult reference materials you use, but please don't try to google this exact problem and copy & paste a solution from stack overflow or any other site. Suppose you are tasked with syncing data from two different sources, a product database, and a storefront. The product database also contains the product taxonomy, i.e., product categories. Each category has a name, can have at most one parent category, and can have zero or more children. The product database provides three pieces of information about a category: the categoryâ€™s id, itâ€™s parent categoryâ€™s id (if any), and the categoryâ€™s name. The storefront, though, has one limitation: a child category cannot be inserted before its parent category has been created. Our job is to write a function that can take a JSON string of categories provided by the product database and sort them in the optimal insertion order for the storefront so that no category insertion will result in an integrity error. The taxonomy for categories can be arbitrarily deep. The return value should also be a JSON string. Your function should take a JSON object representing the categories from the product database and provide as output a list of dictionaries sorted in the proper insertion order. There may be more than one optimal ordering of the categories, but you only have to provide an optimal ordering. You can assume:  The input will always be solvable (there will be no missing parents) The input will always be valid JSON in the format of the example below, with no additional data There may be more than one root category (a category with no parents)  This is a formatted JSON sample input, with one sample child (with both a parent and a child), one child with no children, and sample parent (with no parent) [   {     ""name"": ""Accessories"",     ""id"": 1,     ""parent_id"": 20,   },   {     ""name"": ""Watches"",     ""id"": 57,     ""parent_id"": 1   },   {     ""name"": ""Men"",     ""id"": 20,     ""parent_id"": null   } ] This is a formatted JSON sample solution for the input above: [   {     ""name"": ""Men"",     ""id"": 20,     ""parent_id"": null   },   {     ""name"": ""Accessories"",     ""id"": 1,     ""parent_id"": 20   },   {     ""name"": ""Watches"",     ""id"": 57,     ""parent_id"": 1   } ] When submitting your solution, please provide it as a file containing the function or method which will perform the proper calculations, so we can run tests against it. Below is the general format of an acceptable submission in Javascript: module.exports = function sortCategoriesForInsert (inputJson) {   // Your code happens...   ///   ... which calculates properJsonOutput   return properJsonOutput } Final notes on expected submissions:  Please use standard libraries where possible and limit the business logic to a one file submission. The order of key-value pairs within the JSON output does NOT matter. The whitespace of output JSON does NOT matter.

417371467;2021_July_Panel_Holoviz;https://github.com/kcoleman80/2021_July_Panel_Holoviz;Jupyter Notebook;2021-10-15T04:47:41Z;0;0;0;2021_July_Panel_Holoviz Panel is an open-source Python library that lets you create custom interactive web apps and dashboards by connecting user-defined widgets to plots, images, tables, or text. Compared to other approaches, Panel is novel in that it supports nearly all plotting libraries, works just as well in a Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, uses the same code for both those cases, supports both Python-backed and static HTML/JavaScript exported applications, and can be used to develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code to any particular GUI or web tools. Panel makes it simple to make: Plots with user-defined controls Property sheets for editing parameters of objects in a workflow Control panels for simulations or experiments Custom data-exploration tools Dashboards reporting key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends Data-rich Python-backed web servers and anything in between Panel objects are reactive, immediately updating to reflect changes to their state, which makes it simple to compose viewable objects and link them into simple, one-off apps to do a specific exploratory task. The same objects can then be reused in more complex combinations to build more ambitious apps, while always sharing the same code that works well on its own. Panel lets you move the same code freely between an interactive Jupyter Notebook prompt and a fully deployable standalone server. That way you can easily switch between exploring your data, building visualizations, adding custom interactivity, sharing with non-technical users, and back again at any point, using the same tools and the same code throughout. Panel thus helps support your entire workflow, so that you never have to commit to only one way of using your data and your analyses, and don’t have to rewrite your code just to make it usable in a different way. In many cases, using Panel can turn projects that used to take weeks or months into something you finish on the same day you started, creating a full Python-backed deployed web service for your visualized data in minutes or hours without having to run a software development project or hand your work over to another team.

This website is designed to helps users find safe, affordable and low cost parking to get rest easy while on a hustle. This is a most prominent trouble especially in metropolitan and tier-1 cities where vehicles are used at maximum potential in their daily lives. With no space to park their vehicles, it's evitable to have seen or prone to careless parking on roads or unauthorized places which disrupts the smooth flow of passages for society. ✔Features  It allows users to get suggestions on parking locations (renders on map with information of price and availability using area / pincode) based on their schedules one plans to attend. While searching, it also shows with events nearby. User can dynamically track empty parking spots to park their vehicles in a lot at the nearest slot available and releases slots as car surpasses the location. It allows to book/reserve the parking slots in prior to reaching the authorized parking lot. Opens up the gate/handle of parking lot for vehicles to enter the space using sensing techniques. While exiting, it automatically checks the complete history of the car using vehicle registration number (owner authority, licence checking, pending challans). With vehicle registration number and color of vehicle, user can easily track their vehicle location in a hump through their own device. Using sensor, it updates parking lot metrics which in turn is sent to database for users to view the details. If vehicle is parked in No parking zone, an user can detect vehicle owner details and email that the vehicle has been taken by RTO. Users can also share the best spots via posts for the community.  🙌Join Here 🚀 Join us to come up with a real-time parking solution to tackle and make this workflow more efficient towards effortless parking management system. 🔑Tech Stacks Skills : Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Django, MySQL, IoT Programming Languages : Python, HTML, CSS, JS Contributors are expected to join this Discord Channel here for the project discussion : When raising an issue, do make sure to mention the kind of feature, feature title, short description of the feature and how would you expect it to work.

When printed, iterated or converted into a sequence, its elements will appear in an arbitrary order. Example print set() set([]) print set('HackerRank') set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R']) print set([1,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,0,9,12,22,3]) set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 22]) print set((1,2,3,4,5,5)) set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) print set(set(['H','a','c','k','e','r','r','a','n','k'])) set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n']) print set({'Hacker' : 'DOSHI', 'Rank' : 616 }) set(['Hacker', 'Rank']) print set(enumerate(['H','a','c','k','e','r','r','a','n','k'])) set([(6, 'r'), (7, 'a'), (3, 'k'), (4, 'e'), (5, 'r'), (9, 'k'), (2, 'c'), (0, 'H'), (1, 'a'), (8, 'n')]) Basically, sets are used for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. symmetric_difference Objective  Today, we're learning about a new data type: sets. Concept If the inputs are given on one line separated by a character (the delimiter), use split() to get the separate values in the form of a list. The delimiter is space (ascii 32) by default. To specify that comma is the delimiter, use string.split(','). For this challenge, and in general on HackerRank, space will be the delimiter. Usage:   a = raw_input() 5 4 3 2 lis = a.split() print (lis) ['5', '4', '3', '2']   If the list values are all integer types, use the map() method to convert all the strings to integers.   newlis = list(map(int, lis)) print (newlis) [5, 4, 3, 2]   Sets are an unordered collection of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type. CREATING SETS   myset = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set myset = set()  # Initializing a set myset = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list myset {'a', 'b'}   MODIFYING SETS Using the add() function:   myset.add('c') myset {'a', 'c', 'b'} myset.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens myset.add((5, 4)) myset {'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)}   Using the update() function:   myset.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects myset {'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3} myset.update({1, 7, 8}) myset {'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3} myset.update({1, 6}, [5, 13]) myset {'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3}   REMOVING ITEMS Both the discard() and remove() functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, discard() does nothing, but remove() will raise a KeyError exception.   myset.discard(10) myset {'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3} myset.remove(13) myset {'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3}   COMMON SET OPERATIONS Using union(), intersection() and difference() functions.   a = {2, 4, 5, 9} b = {2, 4, 11, 12} a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b {2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12} a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b {2, 4} a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b {9, 5}   The union() and intersection() functions are symmetric methods:   a.union(b) == b.union(a) True a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a) True a.difference(b) == b.difference(a) False   no_idea! set_add() If we want to add a single element to an existing set, we can use the .add() operation.  It adds the element to the set and returns 'None'. Example    s = set('HackerRank') s.add('H') print s set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R']) print s.add('HackerRank') None print s set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'HackerRank', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])    set_discord()_remove()_pop() .remove(x)  This operation removes element from the set. If element does not exist, it raises a KeyError. The .remove(x) operation returns None. Example    s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) s.remove(5) print s set([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]) print s.remove(4) None print s set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]) s.remove(0) KeyError: 0    .discard(x) This operation also removes element from the set. If element does not exist, it does not raise a KeyError. The .discard(x) operation returns None. Example    s = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) s.discard(5) print s set([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]) print s.discard(4) None print s set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]) s.discard(0) print s set([1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9])    .pop() This operation removes and return an arbitrary element from the set. If there are no elements to remove, it raises a KeyError. Example    s = set([1]) print s.pop() 1 print s set([]) print s.pop() KeyError: pop from an empty set    set_union()_operation .union() The .union() operator returns the union of a set and the set of elements in an iterable. Sometimes, the | operator is used in place of .union() operator, but it operates only on the set of elements in set. Set is immutable to the .union() operation (or | operation). Example    s = set(""Hacker"") print s.union(""Rank"") set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])       print s.union(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])       print s.union(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']) set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])       print s.union(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', (1, 'a'), (2, 'n'), 'H', 'k', (3, 'k'), (0, 'R')])       print s.union({""Rank"":1}) set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'Rank'])       s | set(""Rank"") set(['a', 'R', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n'])    set_intersection()_operation The .intersection() operator returns the intersection of a set and the set of elements in an iterable.  Sometimes, the & operator is used in place of the .intersection() operator, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. The set is immutable to the .intersection() operation (or & operation).    s = set(""Hacker"") print s.intersection(""Rank"") set(['a', 'k'])       print s.intersection(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['a', 'k'])       print s.intersection(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']) set(['a', 'k'])       print s.intersection(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set([])       print s.intersection({""Rank"":1}) set([])       s & set(""Rank"") set(['a', 'k'])    set_difference()_operation .difference() The tool .difference() returns a set with all the elements from the set that are not in an iterable. Sometimes the - operator is used in place of the .difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. Set is immutable to the .difference() operation (or the - operation).    s = set(""Hacker"") print s.difference(""Rank"") set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])       print s.difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])       print s.difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']) set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])       print s.difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k'])       print s.difference({""Rank"":1}) set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'r'])       s - set(""Rank"") set(['H', 'c', 'r', 'e'])    set_symmetric_difference()_operation symmetric_difference() The .symmetric_difference() operator returns a set with all the elements that are in the set and the iterable but not both. Sometimes, a ^ operator is used in place of the .symmetric_difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set. The set is immutable to the .symmetric_difference() operation (or ^ operation).    s = set(""Hacker"") print s.symmetric_difference(""Rank"") set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])       print s.symmetric_difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])       print s.symmetric_difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']) set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])       print s.symmetric_difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])) set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', (0, 'R'), 'r', (2, 'n'), 'k', (1, 'a'), (3, 'k')])       print s.symmetric_difference({""Rank"":1}) set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'Rank', 'r'])       s ^ set(""Rank"") set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'R', 'r'])    set_mutations .update() or |= Update the set by adding elements from an iterable/another set.    H = set(""Hacker"") R = set(""Rank"") H.update(R) print H set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'n', 'r', 'R'])    .intersection_update() or &= Update the set by keeping only the elements found in it and an iterable/another set.    H = set(""Hacker"") R = set(""Rank"") H.intersection_update(R) print H set(['a', 'k'])    .difference_update() or -= Update the set by removing elements found in an iterable/another set.    H = set(""Hacker"") R = set(""Rank"") H.difference_update(R) print H set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'r'])    .symmetric_difference_update() or ^= Update the set by only keeping the elements found in either set, but not in both.    H = set(""Hacker"") R = set(""Rank"") H.symmetric_difference_update(R) print H set(['c', 'e', 'H', 'n', 'r', 'R'])    the_captains_room The list of room numbers contains 31 elements. Since K is 5 , there must be 6 groups of families. In the given list, all of the numbers repeat 5 times except for room number 8. Hence, 8 is the Captain's room number. check_subset Set A= {1 2 3 5 6} Set B= {9 8 5 6 3 2 1 4 7} All the elements of set A are elements of set B. Hence, A set is a subset of set B. check_strict_superset Example Set ([1,3,4]) is a strict superset of set ([1,3]). Set ([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set ([1,3,4]). Set ([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set ([1,3,5]). Innominion_OCT_21_Internship Innomatics Research Labs "

417493316;python-lamda;https://github.com/ceschenbach/python-lamda;Python;2021-10-15T12:34:29Z;0;0;0;Welcome to the AWS CodeStar sample web service This sample code helps get you started with a simple Python web service using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. What's Here This sample includes:  README.md - this file buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your application for deployment to AWS Lambda index.py - this file contains the sample Python code for the web service template.yml - this file contains the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) used by AWS CloudFormation to deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. tests/ - this directory contains unit tests for your application template-configuration.json - this file contains the project ARN with placeholders used for tagging resources with the project ID  Getting Started These directions assume you want to develop on your development environment or a Cloud9 environment. To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the AWS CodeStar user guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#clone-repo.   Create a Python virtual environment. This virtual environment allows you to isolate this project and install any packages you need without affecting the system Python installation. At the terminal, type the following command:  $ virtualenv .venv    Activate the virtual environment:  $ source .venv/bin/activate    Install the SAM CLI. For details see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html   Start the development server:  $ sam local start-api -p 8080    Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a web browser to view your service.   What Do I Do Next? If you have checked out a local copy of your repository you can start making changes to the sample code.  We suggest making a small change to index.py first, so you can see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your project pipeline and deployed to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. (You can watch the pipeline progress on your AWS CodeStar project dashboard.)Once you've seen how that works, start developing your own code, and have fun! To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the sample code and run the python -m unittest discover tests command, which AWS CodeBuild also runs through your buildspec.yml file. To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or add tests to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the build stage of your project pipeline. You can find the test results in the AWS CodeBuild console. Learn more about AWS CodeBuild and how it builds and tests your application here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/concepts.html Learn more about AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and how it works here: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md AWS Lambda Developer Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html Learn more about AWS CodeStar by reading the user guide, and post questions and comments about AWS CodeStar on our forum. User Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/welcome.html Forum: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=248 What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production? AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security advisories for dependencies used within your application. Best Practices: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/best-practices.html?icmpid=docs_acs_rm_sec

A polar coordinate (r,theta) is completely determined by modulus r and phase angle theta. If we convert complex number z to its polar coordinate, we find: r: Distance from z to origin, i.e., root of (x2 + y2)(squared) theta: Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive x-axis to the line segment that joins z to the origin. Python's cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers. cmath.phase This tool returns the phase of complex number z(also known as the argument of z).    phase(complex(-1.0, 0.0)) 3.1415926535897931 abs This tool returns the modulus (absolute value) of complex number z. abs(complex(-1.0, 0.0)) 1.0    Find Angle MBC ABC is a right triangle, at 90 degree at B. Therefore, angle ABC = 90 degree Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC You are given the lengths AB and  BC. Your task is to find MBC(angle) in degrees. Triangle Quest 2 For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is: 1 121 12321 1234321 123454321 You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you. You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement. Note: Using anything related to strings will give a score of 0. Using more than one for-statement will give a score of 0. Mod Divmod One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a. For example:    print divmod(177,10) (17, 7) Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.    Power-Mod Power So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them! Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Call the power function a^b as shown below:    pow(a,b) or a**b It's also possible to calculate a^b mod m. pow(a,b,m) This is very helpful in computations where you have to print the resultant % mod. Note: Here, a and b can be floats or negatives, but, if a third argument is present, b cannot be negative. Note: Python has a math module that has its own pow(). It takes two arguments and returns a float. Frankly speaking, we will never use math.    Triangle Quest You are given a positive integer N. Print a numerical triangle of height N-1 like the one below: 1 22 333 4444 55555 ...... Can you do it using only arithmetic operations, a single for loop and print statement? Use no more than two lines. The first line (the for statement) is already written for you. You have to complete the print statement. Note: Using anything related to strings will give a score of 0. Integer Come In All Sizes Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 2^31-1 (c++ int) or 2^63-1 (C++ long long int). As we know, the result of a^b grows really fast with increasing b. Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

417493501;IST220-Python-Introduction;https://github.com/maf946/IST220-Python-Introduction;Python;2021-10-15T12:35:15Z;0;0;0;"IST 220 Python Introduction You don't need to learn Python for this course, but I do think that at least a passing familiarity is a great asset, regardless of your major or career plans. First, review ""What is Python? Executive Summary"" from python.org. If you are interested, please review the linked comparisons between Python and other languages (this is perhaps especially interesting if you've taken a course like IST 140 and are familiar with Java). Next, once you have a basic familiarity with what Python is, let's get it set up on your virtual machine. We'll be using PyCharm, an integrated development environment, to make things a bit easier to manage. The IDE gives you a graphical application which combines  (this is why it's ""integrated"") several things which you would otherwise have to do with multiple applications, including the terminal. There are other IDEs aside from PyCharm, but I think this one is the best, and there is a free educational version. Everyone using the same IDE, within Ubuntu, reduces variability and makes it much easier for us to provide help if anything goes wrong while you're working on the lab. Installing PyCharm is as simple as installing any of the other programs we've installed so far this semester. Using your virtual machine's terminal, run both of the following commands:   sudo snap install pycharm-educational --classic   sudo apt install python3-pip   Then launch PyCharm by clicking on the app drawer (the 3x3 dots in the lower-left corner of the screen), then typing the first few letters of PyCharm (you don't even need to click in the text box—just start typing). Go through the standard terms of service and data sharing screens (choose whichever you wish), and then you'll be at the ""Welcome to PyCharm"" screen.  Click ""New Project."" Give your project the name ""220PythonIntro"", as shown in the screenshot below. Your ""Location"" field will have your name, instead of ""Marc,"" and the default location will work fine. Leave all of the other buttons and boxes as they are by default, and as shown in the screenshot. Then click ""Create.""  You should be greeted by a screen like the below:  The file main.py contains a series of instructions for the Python interpreter to execute. The typical cycle for development is to make some changes to that file (or other .py Python files), then run the interpreter, see how our code performs, make some more changes, run it again, and so forth. The easiest way to tell PyCharm that we're ready to run the script is to click the green ""Play"" button next to the line 1 marker. I've indicated this with a huge red arrow in the screenshot. Alternatively, you can select View -> Appearance -> Toolbar, and you'll see a row appear near the top of PyCharm which has a fixed-position Run button.  Once you run the script, you'll see ""Hi, PyCharm"" appear in the ""Run"" tool window, as highlighted in the screenshot below.  Let's modify the script to print your name, instead of PyCharm. Line 14 of the script currently reads:     print_hi('PyCharm') Replace 'PyCharm' with 'your_name', ex: 'Michael Myers'. Run it again, and you should see different output:  Congratulations. You are a Python developer, with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities appertaining thereto. Your journey is not complete. Move on to Exploring Basic Python Syntax. "

417515165;Python-Data-Types;https://github.com/skfreego/Python-Data-Types;Python;2021-10-15T13:46:33Z;0;0;0;"Python Data Types HackerRank Challenges| Domain:Python| Sub Domain:Basic Data Types list_comprehension|  List comprehensions are an elegant way to build a list without having to use different for loops to append values one by one.  The simplest form of a list comprehension is: [ expression-involving-loop-variable for loop-variable in sequence ] This will step over every element in a sequence, successively setting the loop-variable equal to every element one at a time. It will then build up a list by evaluating the expression-involving-loop-variable for each one. This eliminates the need to use lambda forms and generally produces a much more readable code than using map() and a more compact code than using a for loop.   ListOfNumbers = [ x for x in range(10) ] # List of integers from 0 to 9 ListOfNumbers [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]   You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3d grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to n. Example: x = 1, y= 1, z = 2, n = 3 All Permutations of |i,j,k| are: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,2],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,2],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,0,2],[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[1,1,2]] Print an array of the elements that do not sum to n = 3 [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,2],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,2]] nested_lists| A nested list is a list that contains another list (i.e.: a list of lists). It is also referred to as a multi-diminsional array. For example, a 2 dimensional array is used below: nested_list = [['blue', 'green'], ['red', 'black'], ['blue', 'white']]  print len(nested_list) # prints 3 print nested_list[1] # prints ['red', 'black'] print nested_list[1][0] # prints red  To go through every element in this list, use a nested for loop. >>> nested_list = [['blue', 'green'], ['red', 'black'], ['blue', 'white']] >>> for inner in nested_list: ...     for value in inner: ...         print value ...  blue green red black blue white  finding_the_percentage| A dictionary is a data type which stores values in pairs. For each element in the dictionary, there is a unique key that points to a value. A dictionary is mutable. It can be changed.  For example: a_dict = {'one': 1} # Here 'one' is the key. Note: The key of a dictionary is immutable. We cannot use a list as a key because a list is mutable. But we can make a tuple of list and use as key. a_dict['two'] = 2 # Adds key 'two' which points to 2 print a_dict['one'] #prints 1 if 'three' in a_dict: # To check whether a certain string exist as a key in the dictionary print a_dict['three'] else: print ""Three not there"" # prints Three not there del a_dict['one'] # Deletes index 'one' and the value associated with it print a_dict # prints {'two': 2} Note: A dictionary is unordered. So, only use the keys to navigate through the dictionary. list| When we talk about storing multiple values in a container-like data structure, the first thing that comes to mind is a list. You can initialize a list as:  arr = list() #or simply arr = [] or with a few elements as: arr = [1,2,3] Elements can be accessed easily similar to most programming languages: print arr[0] #result is 1 print arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] #result is 6 Lists in Python are very versatile. You can add almost anything in a Python list.  In Python, you can create a list of any objects: strings, integers, or even lists. You can even add multiple types in a single list! Let's look at some of the methods you can use on list. 1.) append(x)    Adds a single element x to the end of a list.    arr.append(9)       print arr          # prints [1, 2, 3, 9]  2.) extend(L)         Merges another list L to the end.         arr.extend([10,11])         print arr         # prints [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]  3.) insert(i,x)          Inserts element x at position i.          arr.insert(3,7)          print arr          # prints [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11]  4.) remove(x)          Removes the first occurrence of element x.          arr.remove(10)            arr        # prints [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]  5.) pop()          Removes the last element of a list. If an argument is passed, that index item is popped out.          temp = arr.pop()           print temp           # prints 11  6.) index(x)      Returns the first index of a value in the list. Throws an error if it's not found.          temp = arr.index(3)      print temp      # prints 2  7.) count(x)      Counts the number of occurrences of an element x.      temp = arr.count(1)      print temp      # prints 1  8.) sort() Sorts the list. arr.sort()  	print arr # [1, 2, 3, 7, 9]  9.) reverse() Reverses the list. arr.reverse() print arr # [9, 7, 3, 2, 1]  tuples| Tuples are data structures that look a lot like lists. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable (meaning that they cannot be modified once created). This restricts their use because we cannot add, remove, or assign values; however, it gives us an advantage in space and time complexities. A common tuple use is the swapping of 2 numbers: a, b = b, a Here a,b is a tuple, and it assigns itself the values of b,a. Another awesome use of tuples is as keys in a dictionary. In other words, tuples are hashab  find_the_runner_up_score| ... Innominion_OCT_21_Internship Innomatics Research Labs "

The goal of the contest is to score the most points among your competitors.Points are scored based on a points system corresponding to the accrual of stats by individual players during NFL games. For each contest, competitors draft a team of players filling specific position types. For examples each team could be required to have 1 Quarterback, 2 Running Backs, 2 Wide Receivers, 1 Tight End, and 1 Defense. Each player has a salary in virtual dollars required to be paid to draft the player for the week. Each competitor has a budget of virtual dollars used to fill his team for the contest. Better players (who are anticipated to score a large number of points) have a higher salary cost associated with them. Contests are played on a weekly basis corresponding to a week of the NFL season. Once all NFL games for the week are played, the player who's team scored the most points is named the winner. Columns Week:  Number 1 - 17 corresponding to the week of the NFL season a game took place Year: Number 2017 - 2021 corresponding to the year an NFL season took place GID: Generic ID used by the website as an index for the data. Name: Name of NFL player recording points in the contest Pos: Position of the NFL player recording points in the contest Team: NFL team the player recording points belongs to h/a: 'h' or 'a' designation for whether the game was played at home or away Oppt: 'Opponent' The opposing NFL team the player recording points was competing against FD points: Fantasy points the player recorded on the FanDuel platform FD salary: Virtual dollars required to draft a player for a contest on the FanDuel platform DK points: Fantasy points the player recorded on the DraftKings platform DK salary: Virtual dollars required to draft a player for a contest on the DraftKings platform YH points: Fantasy points the player recorded on the Yahoo Sports platform YH salary: Virtual dollars required to draft a player for a contest on the Yahoo Sports platform

They are loaded in to the data frames and transacted on. They should not be edited. ClientTemplate.py is the superclass. It loads the data from the source files in to a dataframe and prepares the data frame to be transacted on by the individual client objects, which are the subclass of ClientTemplate.py. Clients.py: subclass of ClientTemplate. Takes the standard client template and customizes it based on the client and/or client template. Some things that are customized by client/template are cash symbol, weight column name, cash restrictions. DFHelpers: helper functions to update fields in the provided data frame. Returns the updated data frame. Email: template function to auto create emails. ProRata: current state is not integrated; however, will be a function to prorate cash for a client based on their minimum cash weight. For example, if current cash is 1% and the client cannot accept a file with cash less than 2%, ProRata.py will prorate 1% of cash out of securities based on their weights to proportionately raise the 1% cash required to submit the file. Main.py: Loops through the cleint_dict and client_email dictoinaries to create all the files based on client parameters.  "

It uses the same engineered data and features as the  Logistic Regression Titanic Survivorship project. The custom function rf_mod_assess() returns a dataframe of all of the classifcation report results for each of the 25 trials using Monte Carlo cross validation. See also the KNN Titanic Survivorship project. The code can be viewed here: Titanic_Survivorship_Random_Forest_02.ipynb. Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression and KNN by 2% and 1% respectively.  Random Forests samples the training dataset with replacement (bagging), but trees are constructed in a way that reduces the correlation between individual classifiers (Brownlee, 2021, p.93) providing an improvement over Bagged Trees. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) takes multiple samples from the training dataset with replacement and trains a model for each sample, then averages the predictions of all sub-models to obtain a final averaged prediction (Brownlee, 2021, p. 92). ...  ...

Intermediate steps are not included.   It also contains the Dockerfile and uwsgi.ini files necessary to build a container with a production server. The resulting image works both locally and when deployed to Azure App Service. See Deploy Python using Docker containers.   To run the app locally:  Run the command cd hello_app, to change into the folder that contains the Flask app. Run the command set FLASK_APP=webapp (Windows cmd) or FLASK_APP=webapp (macOS/Linux) to point to the app module. Start the Flask server with flask run.    The startup.py file In the root folder, the startup.py file is specifically for deploying to Azure App Service on Linux without using a containerized version of the app (that is, deploying the code directly, not as a container). Because the app code is in its own module in the hello_app folder (which has an __init__.py), trying to start the Gunicorn server within App Service on Linux produces an ""Attempted relative import in non-package"" error. The startup.py file, therefore, is a shim to import the app object from the hello_app module, which then allows you to use startup:app in the Gunicorn command line (see startup.txt).

This is often continued into A level as students already have a good knowledge of Python. As the exams are biased to roughly 20% code to 80% theory, the time spent learning code is limited, and as a result the code produced by most students could be improved. This repo is a source of ideas from a C# programmer's experience to improve code typically seen at GCSE to a standard more suitable for A level. Some lua code is used initially for examples which is taken from the resource at https://github.com/Inksaver/LuaForSchools

It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets businesses push to manage their system most effectively. This is a software for practice of developing a system from completely scratch. Understanding this will help a lot in system development and basic structure of a system along with GUI with python library Tkinter. This software was originally developed by Amit Kumar Datta Motivation This project is motivated by Web code's inventory managment system. Here his project- Inventory Management System with Database | Complete GUI Python Project. His youtube channel- Web code System Overview  The System consists of two main components -  Admin tab Employee tab  Methodology Dashbord  Dashbord is only available for only Admin. Admin can see full overview of business. Employee  In empolyee tab admin can add, delete and update employee. Supplier  It also available for only Admin. In empolyee tab admin can add, delete and update employee. Category  In Category tab admin can add, delete category. Product  In product tab admin can add, delete and update product. Sales  In sales tab admin can see bills. Billing  This tab is available for employee. In Billing tab employee can create bill with selected price in product tab. Contributing The main reason to publish something open source, is that anyone can just jump in and start contributing to my project. So If you'd like to contribute, be sure to review the contribution guidelines and then please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

417457444;GildedRoseKata;https://github.com/satyaki-mallick/GildedRoseKata;Python;2021-10-15T10:22:10Z;0;0;0;"Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub here. See also Bobby Johnson's description of the kata. I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see the TextTests) As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ""Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"", it'll actually give you better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages. I use this kata as part of my work as a technical coach. I wrote a lot about the coaching method I use in this book Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method. A while back I wrote this article ""Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"" about how you could use this kata in a coding dojo. How to use this Kata The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ""Gilded Rose Requirements"" which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor. You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages. Alternatively, use the ""Text-Based"" tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the next section) Whichever testing approach you choose, the idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design. Gilded Rose Requirements in other languages  English Español Français 日本語 Português Русский ไทย 中文 한국어  Text-Based Approval Testing This code comes with comprehensive tests that use this approach. For information about how to run them, see the texttests README Translating this code More translations are most welcome! I'm very open for pull requests that translate the starting position into additional languages. Please note a translation should ideally include:  a translation of the production code for 'update_quality' and Item one failing unit test complaining that ""fixme"" != ""foo"" a TextTest fixture, ie a command-line program that runs update_quality on the sample data for the number of days specified.  Please don't write too much code in the starting position or add too many unit tests. The idea with the one failing unit test is to tempt people to work out how to fix it, discover it wasn't that hard, and now they understand what this test is doing they realize they can improve it. If your programming language doesn't have an easy way to add a command-line interface, then the TextTest fixture is probably not necessary. Better Code Hub I analysed this repo according to the clean code standards on Better Code Hub just to get an independent opinion of how bad the code is. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the compliance score is low!  "

Features Endpoints:   provider discovery  jwks uri  authorization  token  userinfo  registration  registration_read endpoint  introspection endpoint (https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA/pull/378/commits/473310fb5968561f962bf6bcc6b6eacbf78f0b3e)  token exchange  Requirements  satosa mongodb, see Satosa-Saml2Spid mongo example.  Setup pip install satosa_oidcop  Configuration Anyone can migrate its oidcop configuration, from flask_op or django-oidc-op or whatever, in SATOSA and without any particular efforts. Looking at the example configuration we see that config.op.server_info have a standard SATOSA configuration with the only addition of the following customizations, needed in SATOSA for interoperational needs. These are:  autentication          authentication:           user:             acr: urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:InternetProtocolPassword             class: satosa.frontends.oidcop.user_authn.SatosaAuthnMethod   userinfo         userinfo:          class: satosa.frontends.oidcop.user_info.SatosaOidcUserInfo  authentication inherits oidcop.user_authn.user.UserAuthnMethod and overloads two methods involved in user authentication and verification. These tasks are handled by SATOSA in its authentication backends. userinfo inherits oidcop.user_info.UserInfo and proposes a way to store the claims of the users when they comes from the backend. The claims are stored in the session database (actually mongodb) and then they will be fetched during userinfo endpoint (and also token endpoint, for having  them optionally in id_token claims). SSO and cookies oidcop SSO and cookies were not have been implemented because SATOSA doesn't support logout, because of this they are quite useless at this moment. Client and Session Storage MongoDB is the storage, here some brief descriptions for a demo setup. The interface to SATOSA oidcop storage is satosa.frontends.oidcop.storage.base.SatosaOidcStorage and it have three methods:  get_client_by_id(self, client_id:str, expired:bool = True) store_session_to_db(self, session_manager, **kwargs) load_session_from_db(self, req_args, http_headers, session_manager, **kwargs)  satosa.frontends.oidcop.storage.mongo.Mongodb overloads them to have I/O operations on mongodb. Demo Satosa-Saml2Spid is a custom Satosa configuration to deal with many SAML2 and OIDC Relying parties and many eduGain and SPID Identity Provider.  Contributions Feel free to open issues and pull requests, we build communities! Developer notes Storage design At this time the storage logic is based on oidcop session_manager load/dump/flush methods. Each time a request is handled by an endpoint the oidcop session manager loads the definition from the storage, only which one are strictly related to the request will be loaded in the in memory storage of oidcop.

417444360;Inventorymanagement;https://github.com/anmolpurba/Inventorymanagement;Python;2021-10-15T09:34:36Z;0;0;0;"Inventorymanagement I have build a inventory management system using python programming language.By using this project one can do a lot of things like register a new product to our store, product lookup,remove product from store,etc.which i will be discussing each one by one. I have a list known as product_list which will act as database for our project and also a bin_list which conatains the different location where the product is to be storesd.When you will execute the program you will be given to choose from 7 options according to your need.so the options and their working is as follows-:   REGISTER PRODUCT TO STORE: This option will allow the user to register a new product to the store with its unique product code(upc).The user will give the entire information about the product such as its title, description,upc,costprice,sellingprice,category.By giving the all the information correctly the product will get registered in our store and product will be assigned a sku number and product will be stored in our database product_list also.(exception--> if you will enter a already registered product(upc code) then it will raise a exception that ""product with same upc is already registered"").   PRODUCT LOOKUP: This option will allow the user to get details of a already registered product in the store.The user will have to give the sku code of the product and the first step of the algorithm will find the registered product object from the product_list.If the product is found from the list,then it will print all the details of the product such as its title,upc,description, costprice,sellingprice,category.Else if the product is not found from list it will raise exception that ""Product does not exist"".   REMOVE PRODUCT FROM STORE: This option will allow the user to remove the product from store.The user will have to give the sku of the product and the algorithm will find the product if it is present in the product_list.If the product is found in the product list the code will delete the product from the product_list.In fact this code will find the same product in all the bins(location) and will remove the product from all the bins if found in it.   ADD PRODUCT TO BIN: This option will allow the user to add product to bin(location).The user will give sku of the product,quantity of the product and location as input.Firstly the code the find if the product with given sku is present in the product_list or not.If it is present the code will now get the product with the given sku and it will find the bin with given location.After getting these two values, product and bin, it will add the product and its quantity to the product_dict of the found bin.   REMOVE PRODUCT FROM BIN: This option will allow the user to remove product from bin(location).The user will give sku of the product,quantity of the product and location as input.Firstly the code will find if the product with given sku and bin is present in product_list and bin_list respectively.Then it will check if the quantity of the product with given sku is greater than the given quantity it will remove the quantity from the product_dict of the bin.   VIEW PRODUCTs BY LOCATION: This option will allow the user to view all the products present in the given location.Firstly the code will find the bin from the bin_list and once we found the bin by the given location we will get the product_dict from given bin.The product_dict of the bin will contain of the products.   ADD NEW LOCATION This option will not expect any input from user.It will simply make an object of the bin class and due to init constructor a new location will be assigned to it.Then the bin object will add to the bin_list.

Written in Python. In this project, we take the first step toward solving the problem of separating the mixed X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) image of an overpainted oil painting that has top and bottom layers. In order to obtain distinctive XRF images for the different layers, an autoencoder is needed first to extract features from the hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of the painting. We propose using a convolutional neural network, which is a type of artificial neural network in machine learning, for the architecture of the autoencoder. An artificial neural network has multiple layers, each holds a collection of neurons and can learn information of a certain problem. It is an unsupervised learning method, meaning that the input and output are not labeled and the algorithm needs to discover the patterns in the data by itself. Our results also show this autoencoder’s potential to be adopted as a denoiser for processing hyperspectral images.

An anomalous data point is a deviation from a rule or from what is regarded as normal; an outlier. An anomaly is any event or measurement that is out of the ordinary regardless of whether it is exceptional or not.  Outlier  An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In a sense, this definition leaves it up to the analyst (or a consensus process) to decide what will be considered abnormal. Before abnormal observations can be singled out, it is necessary to characterize normal observations  "

417555775;tsih;https://github.com/balkian/tsih;Python;2021-10-15T15:51:20Z;0;0;0;"TSIH - A dict with a HISTory tsih.Dict is a type of UserDict that allows versioning, backed up by a sqlite3 database.  Transparent operation Only changes (deltas) are stored. Forward-filling of values. A value is reused in future versions, unless it changes. Auto-versioning option (off by default), to produce a new version every time a value change happens. Ability to store related entries as separate dictionaries. Each tsih.Dict has a dict_name that is used in the database to identify the dictionary. Tuple-based indexing. Get and set values by dict_name, version and key.  Usage and examples tsih.Dict objects can be used just like regular dictionaries: >>> from tsih import Dict >>> a = Dict() >>> a['test'] = True >>> a {'test': True} >>> a.get('missing', 5) 5 >>> a['missing'] Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> KeyError: 'missing' But at any point, new versions can be produced: >>> a.version 0 >>> a['start'] = 'now' >>> a {'test': True, 'start': 'now'} >>> a.version = 1 >>> a['start'] = 'one version ago' >>> a {'test': True, 'start': 'one version ago'} Previous values can be accessed using tuple keys, i.e., (version, key): >>> a[(0, 'start')] 'now' >>> a[(1, 'start')] 'one version ago' Each version only ""records"" changes, but later versions (even if they don't exist yet) inherit unchanged values from the previous ones: >>> a[(5, 'start')]   'one version ago' >>> a.version = 5 >>> # Until the value is changed >>> a['start'] = '4 versions ago'  >>> a[(5, 'start')] '4 versions ago' You can access every state of the Dict using None in place of the version and/or the key. In that case, we will get an iterator, which we can turn into a list explicitly or with the .value method. For example, here we get all the changes to the start key: >>> a[(None, 'start')].value() #  [(0.0, 'now'), (1.0, 'one version ago'), (5.0, '4 versions ago')] Similarly, to get the keys and values at a specific version: >>> list(a[(0, None)]) [('start', 'now'), ('test', True)] Or, we can combine both to get the keys and values at every version: >>> a[(None, None)].value() [(0.0, 'start', 'now'), (1.0, 'start', 'one version ago'), (5.0, 'start', '4 versions ago'), (0.0, 'test', True), (1.0, 'test', True), (5.0, 'test', True)] Use cases Tsih was originally part of the Soil Agent-Based Social Simulation framework, where both the environment and the agents need to keep track of state (i.e., attribute) changes.

See https://3dbag.nl. We will introduce the data set, discussing the data model, available formats, data quality and some of the peculiarities. In the hands-on part of the session, we will show how you can make the most out of the data by using Python, whether you integrate with other services or use it directly for analysis. In this part we will focus on CityJSON (http://www.cityjson.org) and cjio (https://github.com/cityjson/cjio), but we will also show other tools that can be helpful for working with the data. Installing the dependencies Python version: 3.6 or above. We used Python 3.8 for developing these materials. With conda Probably the easiest if you install the dependencies with conda. See how to install conda Create a new conda environment and set install the dependencies from the environment.yml file. conda env create --name foss4gnl_3dbag --file environment.yml Not using conda You can also set up everything if you cannot or don't want to use conda. In this case, install the dependencies manually with pip. The dependencies are listed in the environment.yml file.

See the following example. from future_map import FutureMap from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  def make_infinite_input():     count = 0     while True:         yield count         count += 1  def process(value):     return value * 2  if __name__ == '__main__':     with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:         fm = FutureMap(             lambda value: executor.submit(process, value),             make_infinite_input(), buffersize=5         )         for value in fm:             print('Doubled value:', value) For more complicated use case: import time from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  from future_map import FutureMap  class APIClient:     def __init__(self, max_connections):         self.__max_connections = max_connections         self.__executor = None      def __enter__(self):         self.__executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.__max_connections)         return self      def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):         self.__executor.shutdown()         self.__executor = None      def call(self, url):         time.sleep(1)         return ""Response from {}"".format(url)      def call_async(self, url):         if self.__executor is None:             raise Exception(""call_async needs to be called in the runtime context with this APIClient"")         return self.__executor.submit(self.call, url)   def make_urls():     for i in range(100):         yield ""https://example.com/api/resources/{}"".format(i)  if __name__ == '__main__':     with APIClient(max_connections=3) as api_client:         for response in FutureMap(api_client.call_async, make_urls(), buffersize=5):             print(response) API FutureMap(fn, iterable, buffersize) Constructor of FutureMap. FutureMap is an iterable object that maps an iterable object (iterable argument) to a function (fn argument), waits until each future object is done, and yields each result. Please note that this object will yield unordered results.  Arguments  fn: Callable object that takes an argument from iterable, and return a concurrent.futures.Future. iterable: Iterable object. buffersize: Maximum size of internal buffer. Each concurrent.futures.Future object is stored in the buffer until it's done. If the buffer is fulfilled, FutureMap stops reading values from iterable.   Return  FutureMap instance    future_map(fn, iterable, buffersize) Alias of FutureMap. You can use this function if you prefer a similar syntax with the map function. For more details, please refer to FutureMap(fn, iterable, buffersize). Contributing Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. License MIT "

That being the case, I started out using the analog of a planarian worm using its eye dots (which can only sense light and dark) to find food. Because of this framework, I'm still trying to figure out how to handle the issue of reward. Backpropogation is a strong technical solution, but I need more research to figure out how real brains reinforce the connections between neurons. My goal right now, as naive as it is, is to develop a system in which I can add input and output models over time to try and mimic the growth of brains

Tools used:  Abaqus Python xlsxwriter  Description: Pipeline resting on seabed and subjected to pressure and temperature will expand. The forces causing the expansion are the resultant effect of  endcap force, poisson force, thermal force and frictional resistance. This tool has been prepared to verify the behaviour of pipeline expansion due to effect of  wall thickness variation. A basecase abaqus input file of the pipeline expansion was first prepared . The wall thickness in the input file was parameterized in such a way as to allow variation of the thickness value . Six thickness values has been evaluated in this study using the python parametric study method for Abaqus to generate 6 input files and automatically batch runs to obtain 6odbs which is called LOADCASES in this analysis. The thickness values are :[15.9mm,19.1mm,22.3mm,25.1mm,27.1mm, 30.2mm]. The parametric study script  used here is called ""study.psf"". Upon successful completion of the preprocessing, the 6odbs are generated in the project folder. Each odbs contains 6 steps and 1000 pipeline nodes. Thus, the total loadcase data  is 6 x 6 x 1000 = 36000 loadcases. The postprocessing is done in the Python scripts called ""Python postprocessor"". The script open the odbs one after the other ,  loop through each loading steps and extract the results for nodal displacements U1,U2 and U3, then write the result to excel sheet2 with help of xlsxwriter. open sheet1 and write the maximum, minimum values of U1, U2 and U3 and the corrsponding node, loadstep were it occurs. Thus with a table of values of worst thermal expansion (U1) for each loadcase and their corresponding thickness values, a plot is made as shown in the attached excel. From the plot, one can see that as the wall thickness increases, the expansion also increases which depicts a  linear relationship. 1.Preprocessing  prepare a working basecase abaqus model of the pipeline parametrize the variable for study in the input file prepare parametric study file (.psf) that contains the values to be varied run the the.psf file until successful completion   Postprocessing   prepare the python script for postprocessibg open all the odbs, loop through each of them loop through the steps in the odb extract results for U1,U2,U3,etc determine the worst expansion from U1 and associated worstloadcase create excel workbook and worksheets using xlsxwriter library write results to the sheets make a plot of expansion versus wall thickness parametric study completed  "

About the code This code allows the user to input a number of music sheets in the MusicXML file format, which will be trained using the epsilon-greedy Q-Learning algorithm. The output of the program will be a pandas dataframe with each of the notes from the right hand, along with their predicted optimal fingering. A few MusicXML sheets have been provided and are stored in the data/train folder. To test the program, simply follow the ""How to run"" subsection of this README. Q-Learning is not good for generalization and this algorithm works best when the sheets in the test set are part of the training set. This ensures that the reinforcement learning agent has already seen the note combinations and the Q-Values are not empty (which results in standard finger 1). Dependencies The required packages to run this code can be found in the requirements.txt file. To run this file, execute the following code block: $ pip install -r requirements.txt   Alternatively, you can install the required packages manually like this: $ pip install <package>  How to run  Clone the repository Place all MusicXML .xml files that you want the reinforcement learning agent to train on in the data/train folder. Place all the MusicXML .xml files that you want the reinforcement learning agent to label in the data/test folder. Run $ python src/main.py See result  "

Background And Motivational Scenario   Massive amounts of data are constantly generated from the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Nowadays, sensor-based data are used in many applications, like eHealth, smart manufacturing, intelligent traffic management, smart building systems. Such systems rely on monitoring of parameters (e.g., temperature, movement, heart rate, energy consumption, power production, radiation, pressure or air quality) coming from many sensors. Managing these systems generally requires (i) sensor data collection, (ii) data processing and (iii) acting based on the obtained results. Traditionally, such processing is done by employing geographically distributed and massive data centers. Recently, edge computing has been proposed as a solution to perform near-real-time decisions in the proximity of the user. Edge analytics rely on edge nodes (e.g., Raspberry Pi, edge gateway or micro data center) that can be deployed closer to IoT sensors and devices. By keeping data analytics close to the source of data, edge nodes can minimize the latency for decision-making processes as well as to improve energy efficiency of data transmission networks1 . Furthermore, predictive analytics have a huge potential to revolutionize critical and proactive IoT systems such as accurate diagnosis of patients in eHealth, timely maintenance services and failures prevention in smart manufacturing and building systems.      However, meeting the strict latency and accuracy requirements of decision-making processes while performing predictive analytics in modern edge/IoT systems, imposes several issues. Limited (i) storage capabilities and (ii) scalability of edge nodes can hinder the accuracy of predictive analytics and timely decision-making for IoT systems. Also, users and IoT applications can require various prediction horizons (windows) as well as different accuracy thresholds.       We consider data generated by sensor-based monitoring, classified as time-series data. Based on a certain amount of historical time series and recognized patterns, it is possible to predict future values. The conclusions based on analyzed data generally assume that the future system behavior will follow a behavior (pattern or trend) from the measured past. Accordingly, we can use predictive analytics in the context of proactive decision-making.       Figure 1 represents an edge analytics model for smart building use cases. In step (1), data are collected from smart buildings. Due to the rapidly increasing amount of data generated, data can be transferred to the edge layer in step (2). Once a certain amount of data is transferred to the edge layer, the monitoring service cleans data and stores them to the limited edge storage (step 3). The available data are used in step (4) for near-real-time decision-making processes based on the results of predictive analytics, while checking the knowledge base that can be updated with dynamic user/application requirements. The knowledge base should contain recommendations on the best trade-offs between the quantity of the data and prediction accuracy as well as the most suitable forecasting methods for a particular dataset type regarding the prediction horizon. The analytics results are used to take operative decisions, e.g., commands sent to actuators in step (5). The mediator supports the edge layer and communicates with the cloud data repository for resource-demanding batch analytics (step 6)       Assignment            Analyze and determine the best settings in the edge approach for efficient decision-making         processes. The resulting recommended settings should ensure that the edge analytics         component (step 4) can select an appropriate forecasting method having both high         forecast accuracy and low latency by considering (i) target dataset type, (ii) required         prediction horizon and (iii) the most suitable range of historical data as input. We consider         the recommendations to be integrated into the knowledge base, in the future edge design.         “Which range of data and corresponding prediction horizon can ensure the best trade-off between         prediction accuracy and computation latency”, can experimentally be solved by (i) artificially         defining different prediction horizons and ranges of training data using complete datasets, (ii)         applying different forecasting methods for each of defined prediction horizons and training sets,         (iii) observing forecast accuracies and latencies (running time), and (iv) consequently, making         recommendations based on conditions and trade-offs that enable efficient decision-making, i.e.,         which forecasting method and setting can produce the best accuracy-latency trade-off regarding         prediction horizon and given dataset type.        Guidelines and details  The assignment is based on time-series data. A prediction horizon is the number of data points representing prediction length, that is, the amount of data into the future for which the forecasts are to be calculated. During the observation/experimentation phase, we assume that datasets are already complete (without missing values) and without outliers, so the forecasts can be evaluated For the sake of simplicity, the latency is considered as a time consumption or running time of the forecasting procedure. Edge predictive analytics (step 4) for decision-making are often application dependent. However, our recommendations can be related to specific datasets and observations. Edge recommended settings for efficient decision-making must be determined considering:  different patterns of time-series data (different sensor-based datasets); various forecasting methods/models that can be applied; different length of forecast horizons in the experimentation phase; a forecast accuracy measure to evaluate forecasted ranges of data points.

Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. our role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. we ill be able to test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries  and compare our results with their expected results. Project Description In this project, we ill we working on  data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL. Schema for Song Play Analysis Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables. Fact Table songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong [songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent] Dimension Tables users - users in the app [user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level] songs - songs in music database [song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration] artists - artists in music database [artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude] time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units [start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday] Project Template In addition to the data files, the project includes five files: test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database. create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts. etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables. etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook. sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.

What's Here This sample includes:  README.md - this file buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your application for deployment to AWS Lambda index.py - this file contains the sample Python code for the web service template.yml - this file contains the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) used by AWS CloudFormation to deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. tests/ - this directory contains unit tests for your application template-configuration.json - this file contains the project ARN with placeholders used for tagging resources with the project ID  Getting Started These directions assume you want to develop on your development environment or a Cloud9 environment. To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the AWS CodeStar user guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#clone-repo.   Create a Python virtual environment. This virtual environment allows you to isolate this project and install any packages you need without affecting the system Python installation. At the terminal, type the following command:  $ virtualenv .venv    Activate the virtual environment:  $ source .venv/bin/activate    Install the SAM CLI. For details see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html   Start the development server:  $ sam local start-api -p 8080    Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a web browser to view your service.   What Do I Do Next? If you have checked out a local copy of your repository you can start making changes to the sample code.  We suggest making a small change to index.py first, so you can see how changes pushed to your project's repository are automatically picked up by your project pipeline and deployed to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. (You can watch the pipeline progress on your AWS CodeStar project dashboard.)Once you've seen how that works, start developing your own code, and have fun! To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the sample code and run the python -m unittest discover tests command, which AWS CodeBuild also runs through your buildspec.yml file. To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or add tests to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the build stage of your project pipeline. You can find the test results in the AWS CodeBuild console.

User Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/welcome.html Forum: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=248 What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production? AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security advisories for dependencies used within your application.

In this step we want to see how you implement a command-line (CLI) program that lets you manage your todos. The specification for this problem is written down as tests. Since we haven’t actually implemented anything, the tests are currently failing. You have to solve the problem by implementing the application and getting all the tests to pass. Here's how it should work when you're done:  Getting started   Install Python: Python is usually installed by default on most modern systems. To check what your currently have, open a terminal and run the following command: python3 --version  This should output some information on the installed Python version. You can also install python by following these instructions: https://installpython3.com/   You are expected to write the code in todo.py file.   Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal. On Windows: .\todo.bat  On *nix: ./todo.sh    Run Automated Tests 1. Install Node.js You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/ 2. Install dependencies Run npm install to install all dependencies. 3. Create Create symbolic link to the executable file On Windows To create a symbolic link on Windows, you'll need to run either the Windows Command Prompt, or Windows Powershell with administrator privileges. To do so, right-click on the icon for Command Prompt, or Powershell, and choose the ""Run as Administrator"" option. Command Prompt: > mklink todo todo.bat  Powershell: > cmd /c mklink todo todo.bat  On *nix: Run the following command in your shell: $ ln -s todo.sh todo  4. Try running tests. Now run npm test and you will see all the tests failing. As you fill in each functionality, you can re-run the tests to see them passing one by one. A Note about / for Windows Users In the following sections, you'll see many commands prefixed with ./, or paths containing the / (forward-slash) character. If you're using the Windows Command Prompt, then you'll need to replace / with \ (back-slash) for these commands and paths to work as expected. On Windows Powershell, these substitutions are not required. Known Issues A few notes to help you avoid any hiccups while implementing the programming challenge:   If you are on Windows, you might have difficulty getting the tests to pass because of newline UTF encoding issues. If you get stuck, please refer to the thread here.   The tests can fail between 12am and 5.30am (early morning IST). This is because the test parses the date from your system time in UTC format, while in certain programming languages the date and time functions use the local timezone (IST). Accounting for this in the tests will make it more complex and need extra dependencies, so we have kept it intentionally simple. So if you run into this specific problem, you can submit your code as is with the transient date mismatch, or you can change your code to use UTC. Either options are fine.   In Windows machines, the make command might not exist and can prevent you from running the tests. This can be fixed by using WSL, or installing MinGW, among other options.   Specification   The app can be run in the console with ./todo.   The app should read from and write to a todo.txt text file. Each todo item occupies a single line in this file. Here is an example file that has 2 todo items.   water the plants change light bulb    When a todo item is completed, it should be removed from todo.txt and instead added to the done.txt text file. This file has a different format: x 2020-06-12 the text contents of the todo item   the letter x the current date (UTC/GMT) in yyyy-mm-dd format the original text  The date when the todo is marked as completed is recorded in the yyyy-mm-dd format (ISO 8601). For example, a date like 15th August, 2020 is represented as 2020-08-15.   The application must open the files todo.txt and done.txt from where the app is run, and not where the app is located. For example, if we invoke the app like this: $ cd /path/to/plans $ /path/to/apps/todo ls  The application should look for the text files in /path/to/plans, since that is the user’s current directory.   Usage 1. Help Executing the command without any arguments, or with a single argument help prints the CLI usage. $ ./todo help Usage :- $ ./todo add ""todo item""  # Add a new todo $ ./todo ls               # Show remaining todos $ ./todo del NUMBER       # Delete a todo $ ./todo done NUMBER      # Complete a todo $ ./todo help             # Show usage $ ./todo report           # Statistics  2. List all pending todos Use the ls command to see all the todos that are not yet complete. The most recently added todo should be displayed first. $ ./todo ls [2] change light bulb [1] water the plants  3. Add a new todo Use the add command. The text of the todo item should be enclosed within double quotes (otherwise only the first word is considered as the todo text, and the remaining words are treated as different arguments). $ ./todo add ""the thing i need to do"" Added todo: ""the thing i need to do""  4. Delete a todo item Use the del command to remove a todo item by its number. $ ./todo del 3 Deleted todo #3  Attempting to delete a non-existent todo item should display an error message. $ ./todo del 5 Error: todo #5 does not exist.

417610952;Python-Files;https://github.com/satapathypriyanka090/Python-Files;Python;2021-10-15T19:19:31Z;1;1;1;"CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship Test Problem Thanks for applying to the CoronaSafe Engineering fellowship! In this step we want to see how you implement a command-line (CLI) program that lets you manage your todos. The specification for this problem is written down as tests. Since we haven’t actually implemented anything, the tests are currently failing. You have to solve the problem by implementing the application and getting all the tests to pass. Here's how it should work when you're done:  Getting started   Install Python: Python is usually installed by default on most modern systems. To check what your currently have, open a terminal and run the following command: python3 --version  This should output some information on the installed Python version. You can also install python by following these instructions: https://installpython3.com/   You are expected to write the code in todo.py file.   Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal. On Windows: .\todo.bat  On *nix: ./todo.sh    Run Automated Tests 1. Install Node.js You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/ 2. Install dependencies Run npm install to install all dependencies. 3. Create Create symbolic link to the executable file On Windows To create a symbolic link on Windows, you'll need to run either the Windows Command Prompt, or Windows Powershell with administrator privileges. To do so, right-click on the icon for Command Prompt, or Powershell, and choose the ""Run as Administrator"" option. Command Prompt: > mklink todo todo.bat  Powershell: > cmd /c mklink todo todo.bat  On *nix: Run the following command in your shell: $ ln -s todo.sh todo  4. Try running tests. Now run npm test and you will see all the tests failing. As you fill in each functionality, you can re-run the tests to see them passing one by one. A Note about / for Windows Users In the following sections, you'll see many commands prefixed with ./, or paths containing the / (forward-slash) character. If you're using the Windows Command Prompt, then you'll need to replace / with \ (back-slash) for these commands and paths to work as expected. On Windows Powershell, these substitutions are not required. Known Issues A few notes to help you avoid any hiccups while implementing the programming challenge:   If you are on Windows, you might have difficulty getting the tests to pass because of newline UTF encoding issues. If you get stuck, please refer to the thread here.   The tests can fail between 12am and 5.30am (early morning IST). This is because the test parses the date from your system time in UTC format, while in certain programming languages the date and time functions use the local timezone (IST). Accounting for this in the tests will make it more complex and need extra dependencies, so we have kept it intentionally simple. So if you run into this specific problem, you can submit your code as is with the transient date mismatch, or you can change your code to use UTC. Either options are fine.   In Windows machines, the make command might not exist and can prevent you from running the tests. This can be fixed by using WSL, or installing MinGW, among other options.   Specification   The app can be run in the console with ./todo.   The app should read from and write to a todo.txt text file. Each todo item occupies a single line in this file. Here is an example file that has 2 todo items.   water the plants change light bulb    When a todo item is completed, it should be removed from todo.txt and instead added to the done.txt text file. This file has a different format: x 2020-06-12 the text contents of the todo item   the letter x the current date (UTC/GMT) in yyyy-mm-dd format the original text  The date when the todo is marked as completed is recorded in the yyyy-mm-dd format (ISO 8601). For example, a date like 15th August, 2020 is represented as 2020-08-15.   The application must open the files todo.txt and done.txt from where the app is run, and not where the app is located. For example, if we invoke the app like this: $ cd /path/to/plans $ /path/to/apps/todo ls  The application should look for the text files in /path/to/plans, since that is the user’s current directory.   Usage 1. Help Executing the command without any arguments, or with a single argument help prints the CLI usage. $ ./todo help Usage :- $ ./todo add ""todo item""  # Add a new todo $ ./todo ls               # Show remaining todos $ ./todo del NUMBER       # Delete a todo $ ./todo done NUMBER      # Complete a todo $ ./todo help             # Show usage $ ./todo report           # Statistics  2. List all pending todos Use the ls command to see all the todos that are not yet complete. The most recently added todo should be displayed first. $ ./todo ls [2] change light bulb [1] water the plants  3. Add a new todo Use the add command. The text of the todo item should be enclosed within double quotes (otherwise only the first word is considered as the todo text, and the remaining words are treated as different arguments). $ ./todo add ""the thing i need to do"" Added todo: ""the thing i need to do""  4. Delete a todo item Use the del command to remove a todo item by its number. $ ./todo del 3 Deleted todo #3  Attempting to delete a non-existent todo item should display an error message. $ ./todo del 5 Error: todo #5 does not exist. Nothing deleted.  5. Mark a todo item as completed Use the done command to mark a todo item as completed by its number. $ ./todo done 1 Marked todo #1 as done.  Attempting to mark a non-existed todo item as completed will display an error message. $ ./todo done 5 Error: todo #5 does not exist.  6. Generate a report Use the report command to see the latest tally of pending and completed todos. $ ./todo report yyyy-mm-dd Pending : 1 Completed : 4  Improving README.md If you feel like we are missing out steps, feel free to make a pull request.

Example: >>> a = ""this is a string"" >>> a = a.split("" "") # a is converted to a list of strings. >>> print a ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string'] Joining a string is simple: >>> a = ""-"".join(a) >>> print a this-is-a-string What's Your Name? Mutations We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed). Let's try to understand this with an example. You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it. Example: >>> string = ""abracadabra"" You can access an index by: >>> print string[5] a What if you would like to assign a value? >>> string[5] = 'k' Traceback (most recent call last): File """", line 1, in  TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment How would you approach this? One solution is to convert the string to a list and then change the value. Example:    string = ""abracadabra"" l = list(string) l[5] = 'k' string = ''.join(l) print string abrackdabra Another approach is to slice the string and join it back. Example: string = string[:5] + ""k"" + string[6:] print string abrackdabra    Find a String In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive. String Validators Python has built-in string validation methods for basic data. It can check if a string is composed of alphabetical characters, alphanumeric characters, digits, etc. str.isalnum() This method checks if all the characters of a string are alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z and 0-9).    print 'ab123'.isalnum() True print 'ab123#'.isalnum() False    str.isalpha() This method checks if all the characters of a string are alphabetical (a-z and A-Z).    print 'abcD'.isalpha() True print 'abcd1'.isalpha() False    str.isdigit() This method checks if all the characters of a string are digits (0-9).    print '1234'.isdigit() True print '123edsd'.isdigit() False    str.islower() This method checks if all the characters of a string are lowercase characters (a-z).    print 'abcd123#'.islower() True print 'Abcd123#'.islower() False    str.isupper() This method checks if all the characters of a string are uppercase characters (A-Z).    print 'ABCD123#'.isupper() True print 'Abcd123#'.isupper() False    Text Alignment In Python, a string of text can be aligned left, right and center. .ljust(width) This method returns a left aligned string of length width.    width = 20 print 'HackerRank'.ljust(width,'-') HackerRank----------    .center(width) This method returns a centered string of length width.    width = 20 print 'HackerRank'.center(width,'-') -----HackerRank----       .rjust(width) This method returns a right aligned string of length width.    width = 20 print 'HackerRank'.rjust(width,'-') ----------HackerRank    Text Wrap You are given a string S and width w. Designer Door Mat Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:  1. Mat size must be MXN. (N is an odd natural number, and M is 3 times N.)  2. The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.   3. The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.  Sample Designs: Size: 7 x 21  ---------.|.--------- ------.|..|..|.------ ---.|..|..|..|..|.--- -------WELCOME------- ---.|..|..|..|..|.--- ------.|..|..|.------ ---------.|.---------  Size: 11 x 33 ---------------.|.--------------- ------------.|..|..|.------------ ---------.|..|..|..|..|.--------- ------.|..|..|..|..|..|..|.------ ---.|..|..|..|..|..|..|..|..|.--- -------------WELCOME------------- ---.|..|..|..|..|..|..|..|..|.--- ------.|..|..|..|..|..|..|.------ ---------.|..|..|..|..|.--------- ------------.|..|..|.------------ ---------------.|.---------------  String Formatting Given an integer, n, print the following values for each integer i from 1 to n:  1. Decimal  2. Octal  3. Hexadecimal (capitalized)  4. Binary  The four values must be printed on a single line in the order specified above for each i from 1 to n. Each value should be space-padded to match the width of the binary value of n. Alphabet Rangoli You are given an integer, N. Your task is to print an alphabet rangoli of size N. (Rangoli is a form of Indian folk art based on creation of patterns.) Different sizes of alphabet rangoli are shown below: #size 3 ----c---- --c-b-c-- c-b-a-b-c --c-b-c-- ----c---- #size 5 --------e-------- ------e-d-e------ ----e-d-c-d-e---- --e-d-c-b-c-d-e-- e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e --e-d-c-b-c-d-e-- ----e-d-c-d-e---- ------e-d-e------ --------e-------- #size 10 ------------------j------------------ ----------------j-i-j---------------- --------------j-i-h-i-j-------------- ------------j-i-h-g-h-i-j------------ ----------j-i-h-g-f-g-h-i-j---------- --------j-i-h-g-f-e-f-g-h-i-j-------- ------j-i-h-g-f-e-d-e-f-g-h-i-j------ ----j-i-h-g-f-e-d-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j---- --j-i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-- j-i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j --j-i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-- ----j-i-h-g-f-e-d-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j---- ------j-i-h-g-f-e-d-e-f-g-h-i-j------ --------j-i-h-g-f-e-f-g-h-i-j-------- ----------j-i-h-g-f-g-h-i-j---------- ------------j-i-h-g-h-i-j------------ --------------j-i-h-i-j-------------- ----------------j-i-j---------------- ------------------j------------------ The center of the rangoli has the first alphabet letter a, and the boundary has the Nth alphabet letter (in alphabetical order). Capitalize! You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck. alison heck => Alison Heck Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately. The Minion Game Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'. Game Rules Both players are given the same string, S. Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string S. Stuart has to make words starting with consonants. Kevin has to make words starting with vowels. The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings. Scoring A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string S. For Example: String S = BANANA Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points. Merge the Tools! Consider the following:  1. A string, s, of length  where s=c0,c1.....cn-1.  2. An integer, k, where k is a factor of n.  We can split s into n/k subsegments where each subsegment, ti, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s. Then, use each ti to create string ui such that:   1. The characters in ui are a subsequence of the characters in ti.   2. Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in ui         occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index j in ti occurs at a previous         index <j in ti, then do not include the character in string ui.  Given s and k, print n/k lines where each line  denotes string ui. "

Table of Contents   About The Project  Built With    Getting Started  Installation   Contributing Contact Acknowledgements   About The Project  People use sentences to express their feelings, some may be sarcastic, some may be positive, some of them can be negative as well as neutral. I found it interesting to develop a tool which can figure out the type of sentence and here we are! Here's why:  To apply python sentiment analysis cncept in real life To learn how python libraries contribute in sentiment analysis To understand the concept and usage of Flask in application To ease the process of analyzing entity wise sentiment from huge number of senetences which is manually unfeasible Not the least, to work upon data apply the concepts of python for data science  Of course, there is much more to dive deep in sentiment analysis as well as data world. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this project! A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements. Built With  Python for Data Science Flask Sentiment Analysis  Getting Started This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. Installation 1.Install Python on your machine depending upon OS https://realpython.com/installing-python/ 2.

417628534;luxury_python_template;https://github.com/woernerm/luxury_python_template;Python;2021-10-15T20:38:07Z;0;0;0;"The Luxury Python Template       There are great tools available to automatically style, analyze and build your code. They help you deliver better products faster. However, you have to learn how they work, configure them and clean up after them. It’s easy to forgo this tedious work in the beginning when all you can think about is the bright idea behind your new python package. Will you do that later on? Probably not, because then chances are high that you get hundreds of complaints from these tools and fixing them all will likely set you back for weeks. Its way more fun to focus on new features anyway.   Writing better code would be so much easier if any new project, regardless of whether it starts out as an afternoon experiment or the next big thing, would already include all of the bells and whistles that professional packages use. For free and without having to register yourself for yet another online service.   With the luxury python template, you can have all that right from the start! It is very opinionated, meaning the only thing you have to think about is the project name. It comes with a single, zero configuration command-line tool. Its options are intentionally limited and therefore easy to remember. You get everything with a single call of: python package.py build This includes:  Installing all needed dependencies. Sorting import statements alphabetically with isort. Styling your code Black. Checking for residual style errors with Flake8. Checking for security issues with Bandit. Checking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies with Safety. Running tests with Unittest and evaluating test coverage with Coverage.py Generating documentation with Sphinx and markdown support from MySt. Checking for undocumented code (built into package.py). Generating a single, beautiful report for all of the above with Pico.css. Building wheel files and incrementing the version number according to calendar versioning. Generating badges with the most important metrics for your repository like the ones shown above. Removing temporary files and folders.  Example Report The package.py tool that comes with the template can generate a single, beautiful report that summarizes the results of the above-mentioned tools. Want an example? Have a look at the following, problematic code: import hashlib import subprocess  from flask import Flask  def getHash(password: str):     """"""     This is an example function for encrypting passwords.      Args:         pw: The password to be encrypted.     """"""     return hashlib.md5(password.encode(""utf-8"")) In this example, the code is stored in src/bad_example.py. If you run python package.py build you will get the report. Have a look! Quick Guide  The template follows the instructions of the PyPa packaging tutorial. So, it should look familiar to most people. Using the template is easy. Just click the green ""Use this template"" button above (you need to be signed into GitHub) to create your own repository with all the files automatically copied from this template. Alternatively, you may just download / clone a copy of the files. Provide some information about your project in setup.cfg. You can find details about the fields in the PyPa packaging tutorial. You may leave the version as it is. It is set automatically by package.py. Rename src/pythontemplate to whatever you like. The name determines how to import the package in a python script. You should therefore omit spaces, underscores, and dashes. You can add as many of these top-level folders as you like.  Commands You can access the help of package.py by running: python package.py --help As explained above, you can build your wheel files and get a detailed report about your code by running: python package.py build If you only want the detailed report, just run: python package.py report If you want to generate just the documentation and not get any report, use: python package.py doc If you want to remove the wheel files, documentation, and report: python package.py remove License The package is distributed under Apache License 2.0. You can use it for anything you want! Attribution would be nice, but you do not have to.  ;) "

The last update to this file was: August 17, 2021 Reminders  Your code must be placed in the run.py file Your dependencies must be placed in the requirements.txt file Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly  Creating the Heroku app When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:  heroku/python heroku/nodejs  You must then create a Config Var called PORT. Set this to 8000 If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another Config Var called CREDS and paste the JSON into the value field. Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal. Constraints The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.  Happy coding!

These are shell wrappers ONLY and are not a solution set (which is a separately repository, not yet released). For convenience to the reader, some basic functionality has already been implemented (such as configuration logic, consts, interfaces, and test cases). The code in this repository is largely comprised of shell classes that are designed to be implemented by the reader and are NOT solutions. These shell classes and their relationships respresent a notional design that aligns with the requirements listed in Programming the IoT Requirements. These requirements encapsulate the programming exercises presented in my book Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions. How to use this repository If you're reading Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions, you'll see a tie-in with the exercises described in each chapter and this repository. Most of the code in the main src tree is NOT implemented by design. It's intended for you - as the reader of my book (and possibly a student in one of my IoT courses) - to implement by filling in the implementation details as you work through each exercise. A solution set is available, although I haven't yet released it. Stay tuned for updates on this topic. This repository aligns to exercises in Programming the Internet of Things These components are all written in Python3, and correlate to the exercises designed for the Constrained Device Application (CDA) specified in my book Programming the Internet of Things: An Introduction to Building Integrated, Device to Cloud IoT Solutions. Since Python is also used for various cloud computing activities, there are other components that may be introduced as Cloud Service Functions (CSF) in the future, as they will share some of the common data management code written for the CDA exercises. How to navigate the directory structure for this repository This repository is comprised of the following top level paths:  config: Contains basic configuration file(s). src: Contains the following source trees:  src/main/python: The main source tree for python-components. Keep in mind that most of these classes are shell representations ONLY and must be implemented as part of the exercises referenced above. src/test/python: The test source tree for python-components. These are designed to perform very basic unit and integration testing of the implementation of the exercises referenced above. This tree is sectioned by part - part01, part02, and part03 - which correspond to the structure of Programming the Internet of Things.    Here are some other files at the top level that are important to review:  basic_imports.txt: The core library dependencies - use pip to install. cv_imports.txt: The optional CV library dependencies - STILL BEING TESTED - use pip to install. README.md: This README. LICENSE: The repository's LICENSE file.  Lastly, here are some 'dot' ('.{filename}') files pertaining to dev environment setup that you may find useful (or not - if so, just delete them after cloning the repo):  .gitignore: The obligatory .gitignore that you should probably keep in place, with any additions that are relevant for your own cloned instance. .project: The Eclipse IDE project configuration file that may / may not be useful for your own cloned instance. Note that using this file to help create your Eclipse IDE project will result in the project name 'piot-python-components' (which can be changed, of course). .pydevproject: The Eclipse IDE and PyDev-specific configuration file for your Python environment that may / may not be useful for your own cloned instance.  NOTE: The directory structure and all files are subject to change based on feedback I receive from readers of my book and students in my IoT class, as well as improvements I find to be helpful for overall repo betterment. Other things to know Pull requests PR's are disabled while the codebase is being developed. Updates Much of this repository, and in particular unit and integration tests, will continue to evolve, so please check back regularly for potential updates.

This is a personal desktop assistant written in Python and Tkinter. How does it work?  Download the repo and copy the default configuration files that end in .json. Rename the copied files to clock.json and weather.json. You can then edit the configuration of the clock and weather widgets through their configuration files. You should get an OpenWeatherMap account setup and put your API key, zip code and country abbreviation in the corresponding fields inside of your weather.json. You then install the required pip packages using the requirements.txt file. Then you run python ./src/main.py.  You can close the application by right clicking on any of the text and the window bar will appear, you can then close the application. NOTE: This can sometimes be a bit finicky, just keep trying or you can kill the program from your process list. LINUX / MAC IMPORTANT Linux: Linux tkinter does not support completely transparent backgrounds so the app will have a semi transparent grey background. Linux also has issues displaying emoji, so in the weatherTypes field inside of weather.json you can put text or other symbols to represent the weather types. Mac: I can't test Mac compatability because I don't own a Mac. If there are any issues on Mac, feel free to let me know and I'll try my best to fix them.

While they accept may different items, old vehicles are their most valuable, so they want to keep better track of all the different ones they have. Tasks  Allow for four different vehicle types (listed below) to be created and edited.  For each Vehicle type, only display the relevant fields to the user  For example: If a a Coupe is being created/edited, do not show the ""Automatic sliding doors"" field.   Use backend/src/database.py as a stubbed out database service to persist objects. It'll be wiped out each time you restart the backend, but should be sufficiet for our purposes.   After each vehicle is created, register it using the VehicleRegistrationService (at backend/src/vehicle_registration_service.py) and permanently associate that registration ID with the vehicle. List all vehicles on http://localhost:4200/vehicles with their type, nickname, mileage rating and registration ID  mileage rating is defined as:  low: mileage < 10,000 medium: 10,000 <= mileage < 100,000 high: 100,000 <= mileage      Vehicle Types  Sedan  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-4, default: 4 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Coupe  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-2, default: 2 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Mini-Van  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-4, default: 4 Doors: 0-4, default: 4  For each door: (Tip: Make sure everything else is working before addressing this)  Sliding: boolean, default: false     Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works   Motorcycle  Nickname: string Mileage: integer Wheels: 0-2, default: 2 Engine status: works, fixable, junk, default: works Seat status: works, fixable, junk, default: works    Guildelines Please don't spend more than two (2) hours on this project! The goal is not to add every bell, whistle, feature and optimization that you can think of. The goal is to both see an example of working code that you write and see how you do implementing realistic (albeit contrived...) features. You will be judged on how accurately you complete the above tasks and the quality of the code you write. The backend has some routes stubbed out and the frontend has been initialized via Angular CLI. You are free to make any and all changes you'd like to complete the assignment. Getting Started See SETUP.md for instructions on how to get your development envrionment working. If you have any questions, especially regarding setup, please contact us so we can get it sorted out ASAP! When you are finished, push all changes to the repo on GitHub and email us that you've finished! Feel free to to open a pull request or leave any other comments on specific commits or the repo as you see fit. Notes  If you have any issues at all, especially with getting your development environment working, please reach out to us ASAP. Our intention isn't to make you troubleshoot an existing project's configuration. (You wouldn't spend the majority of your work day doing that in real life). We are more than happy to do that for you! Make your first priority getting everything to work! Save the bonus points for after you get things working all the way through.

Do some people say what is going on here? the answer is simple by taking the human face and drawing face data together for the training model. Then, we connect the model into our human generator app finally, when you draw the human face then our model will predict what the person looks like. for this project, the best example is to predict the suspected person. Getting Started This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:  Lab: Write your first Flutter app Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples  For help getting started with Flutter, view our online documentation, which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference. I amn't good on drawing sorry for bad ouput but the output look like  any one who want the final model he/she can contact me using using my email eyosimar524@gmail.com and on my telegram account using @LindaAug1

I will be using a pay scale data set containing salary information for different colleges majors. The main module uses methods from the pandas library to process the data set and gain insights to answers the following questions: Basic requirements: • Which degrees have the highest starting salaries?  • Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?   Stretch requirements: • What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?  This is based on the learning resources provided by day 71 the ""100 days of code"" Udemy course, please see link for the course under ""Useful links"". Software Demo Video Data Analysis Results • Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? Major with the highest starting salary Major name: Physician Assistant Salary: $74300.0 Major with the highest mid-career salary Major name: Chemical Engineering Salary: $107000.0  • Which majors have the lowest earnings after college? Major with the lowest starting salary Major name: Spanish Salary: $34000.0 Major with the lowest mid-career salary Major name: Education Salary: $52000.0  • What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint? The 5 lowest risk majors are: index      Undergraduate Major  difference 40                     Nursing     50700.0 43         Physician Assistant     57600.0 41                   Nutrition     65300.0 49                     Spanish     65400.0 27  Health Care Administration     66400.0 Development Environment For the development environment, I will be using VS code as a my IDE running on Ubuntu 21.10 with GNOME 40. Git and Github are used for source control and repository management. The code will be written in python under a virtual environment for lib dependencies for Pandas. Data analysis and procedures is made possible using the pandas library. Autopep8 libary has been used for code formatting. Useful Websites  Udemy course ""100 days of code"" Pandas documentation Data set source ""Payscale""  Future Work Some other questions that I would like to answer from analysing the data set in the future are: • Which degrees have the highest earning potential? • Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?

Please do not fork this repository directly on GitHub. Instead, please use GitHub's ""template"" function following the instructions below to copy this workshop-template repository and customize it for your workshop.   Please do your work in your repository's gh-pages branch, since that is what is automatically published as a website by GitHub.   Once you are done, please also let us know the workshop URL. If this is a self-organised workshop, you should also fill in the self-organized workshop form (if you have not already done so), so we can keep track of all workshops. We build the list of workshops on our websites from the data included in your index.md page. We can only do that if you customize that page correctly and let us know the workshop URL.   If you run into problems, or have ideas about how to make this process simpler, please get in touch. The pages on customizing your website, the FAQ, and the design notes have more detail on what we do and why. And please note: if you are teaching Git, please create a separate repository for your learners to practice in. Video Tutorial There is a YouTube video that demonstrates how to create a workshop website. Creating a Repository   Log in to GitHub. (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.) You must be logged in for the remaining steps to work.   On this page (https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template), click on the green ""Use this template"" button (top right)    Select the owner for your new repository. (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)   Choose a name for your workshop website repository. This name should have the form YYYY-MM-DD-site, e.g., 2016-12-01-oomza, where YYYY-MM-DD is the start date of the workshop. If your workshop is held online, then the respository name should have -online in the end. e.g., 2016-12-01-oomza-online   Make sure the repository is public, leave ""Include all branches"" unchecked, and click on ""Create repository from template"". You will be redirected to your new copy of the workshop template respository.   Your new website will be rendered at https://your_username.github.io/YYYY-MM-DD-site. For example, if your username is gvwilson, the website's URL will be https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza.   If you experience a problem, please get in touch. Customizing Your Website (Required Steps) There are two ways of customizing your website. You can either:  edit the files directly in GitHub using your web browser clone the repository on your computer and update the files locally  Updating the files on GitHub in your web browser   Go into your newly-created repository, which will be at https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site. For example, if your username is gvwilson, the repository's URL will be https://github.com/gvwilson/2016-12-01-oomza.   Ensure you are on the gh-pages branch by clicking on the branch under the drop down in the menu bar (see the note below):    Edit the header of index.md to customize the list of instructors, workshop venue, etc. You can do this in the browser by clicking on it in the file view on GitHub and then selecting the pencil icon in the menu bar:  Editing hints are embedded in index.md, and full instructions are in the customization instructions.   Remove the notice about using the workshop template in the index.md file. You can safely delete everything between the {% comment %} and {% endcomment %} (included) as indicated below (about from line 35 to line 51): {% comment %} <------------ remove from this line 8< ============= For a workshop delete from here ============= For a workshop please delete the following block until the next dashed-line {% endcomment %}  <div class=""alert alert-danger"">   .... </div>  {% comment %}  8< ============================= until here ================== {% endcomment %} <--------- until this line    Edit _config.yml to customize certain site-wide variables, such as: carpentry (to tell your participants the lesson program for your workshop), curriculum and flavor for the curriculum  taught in your workshop, and title (overall title for all pages). Editing hints are embedded in _config.yml, and full instructions are in the customization instructions.   Edit the schedule.html file to edit the schedule for your upcoming workshop. This file is located in the _includes directory, make sure to choose the one from the appropriate dc (Data Carpentry workshop), lc (Library Carpentry), or swc (Software Carpentry) subdirectory.   Working locally  Note: you don't have to do this, if you have already updated your site using the web interface.  If you are already familiar with Git, you can clone the repository to your desktop, edit index.md, _config.yml, and schedule.html following the instruction above there, and push your changes back to the repository. git clone https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site In order to view your changes once you are done editing, if you have bundler installed (see the installation instructions below), you can preview your site locally with: make serve and go to http://0.0.0.0:4000 to preview your site. Before pushing your changes to your repository, we recommend that you also check for any potential issues with your site by running: make workshop-check Once you are satisfied with the edits to your site, commit and push the changes to your repository. A few minutes later, you can go to the GitHub Pages URL for your workshop site and preview it. In the example above, this is https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza. The finished page should look something like this. Optional but Recommended Steps Update your repository description and link your website At the top of your repository on GitHub you'll see No description, website, or topics provided. — Edit  Click 'Edit' and add:   A very brief description of your workshop in the ""Description"" box (e.g., ""Oomza University workshop, Dec. 2016"")   The URL for your workshop in the ""Website"" box (e.g., https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza)   This will help people find your website if they come to your repository's home page. Update the content of the README file You can change the README.md file in your website's repository, which contains these instructions, so that it contains a short description of your workshop and a link to the workshop website. Additional Notes Note: please do all of your work in your repository's gh-pages branch, since GitHub automatically publishes that as a website. Note: this template includes some files and directories that most workshops do not need, but which provide a standard place to put extra content if desired. See the design notes for more information about these. Further instructions are available in the customization instructions. This FAQ includes a few extra tips (additions are always welcome) and these notes on the background and design of this template may help as well. Creating Extra Pages In rare cases, you may want to add extra pages to your workshop website. You can do this by putting either Markdown or HTML pages in the website's root directory and styling them according to the instructions give in the lesson template. Installing Software If you want to set up Jekyll so that you can preview changes on your own machine before pushing them to GitHub, you must install the software described in the lesson example setup instructions. Setting Up a Separate Repository for Learners If you are teaching Git, you should create a separate repository for learners to use in that lesson. You should not have them use the workshop website repository because:   your workshop website repository contains many files that most learners don't need to see during the lesson, and   you probably don't want to accidentally merge a damaging pull request from a novice Git user into your workshop's website while you are using it to teach.   You can call this repository whatever you like, and add whatever content you need to it. Getting and Giving Help We are committed to offering a pleasant setup experience for our learners and organizers. If you find bugs in our instructions, or would like to suggest improvements, please file an issue or mail us. "

Please do not fork this repository directly on GitHub. Instead, please use GitHub's ""template"" function following the instructions below to copy this workshop-template repository and customize it for your workshop.   Please do your work in your repository's gh-pages branch, since that is what is automatically published as a website by GitHub.   Once you are done, please also let us know the workshop URL. If this is a self-organised workshop, you should also fill in the self-organized workshop form (if you have not already done so), so we can keep track of all workshops. We build the list of workshops on our websites from the data included in your index.md page. We can only do that if you customize that page correctly and let us know the workshop URL.   If you run into problems, or have ideas about how to make this process simpler, please get in touch. The pages on customizing your website, the FAQ, and the design notes have more detail on what we do and why. And please note: if you are teaching Git, please create a separate repository for your learners to practice in. Video Tutorial There is a YouTube video that demonstrates how to create a workshop website. Creating a Repository   Log in to GitHub. (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.) You must be logged in for the remaining steps to work.   On this page (https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template), click on the green ""Use this template"" button (top right)    Select the owner for your new repository. (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)   Choose a name for your workshop website repository. This name should have the form YYYY-MM-DD-site, e.g., 2016-12-01-oomza, where YYYY-MM-DD is the start date of the workshop. If your workshop is held online, then the respository name should have -online in the end. e.g., 2016-12-01-oomza-online   Make sure the repository is public, leave ""Include all branches"" unchecked, and click on ""Create repository from template"". You will be redirected to your new copy of the workshop template respository.   Your new website will be rendered at https://your_username.github.io/YYYY-MM-DD-site. For example, if your username is gvwilson, the website's URL will be https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza.   If you experience a problem, please get in touch. Customizing Your Website (Required Steps) There are two ways of customizing your website. You can either:  edit the files directly in GitHub using your web browser clone the repository on your computer and update the files locally  Updating the files on GitHub in your web browser   Go into your newly-created repository, which will be at https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site. For example, if your username is gvwilson, the repository's URL will be https://github.com/gvwilson/2016-12-01-oomza.   Ensure you are on the gh-pages branch by clicking on the branch under the drop down in the menu bar (see the note below):    Edit the header of index.md to customize the list of instructors, workshop venue, etc. You can do this in the browser by clicking on it in the file view on GitHub and then selecting the pencil icon in the menu bar:  Editing hints are embedded in index.md, and full instructions are in the customization instructions.   Remove the notice about using the workshop template in the index.md file. You can safely delete everything between the {% comment %} and {% endcomment %} (included) as indicated below (about from line 35 to line 51): {% comment %} <------------ remove from this line 8< ============= For a workshop delete from here ============= For a workshop please delete the following block until the next dashed-line {% endcomment %}  <div class=""alert alert-danger"">   .... </div>  {% comment %}  8< ============================= until here ================== {% endcomment %} <--------- until this line    Edit _config.yml to customize certain site-wide variables, such as: carpentry (to tell your participants the lesson program for your workshop), curriculum and flavor for the curriculum  taught in your workshop, and title (overall title for all pages). Editing hints are embedded in _config.yml, and full instructions are in the customization instructions.   Edit the schedule.html file to edit the schedule for your upcoming workshop. This file is located in the _includes directory, make sure to choose the one from the appropriate dc (Data Carpentry workshop), lc (Library Carpentry), or swc (Software Carpentry) subdirectory.   Working locally  Note: you don't have to do this, if you have already updated your site using the web interface.  If you are already familiar with Git, you can clone the repository to your desktop, edit index.md, _config.yml, and schedule.html following the instruction above there, and push your changes back to the repository. git clone https://github.com/your_username/YYYY-MM-DD-site In order to view your changes once you are done editing, if you have bundler installed (see the installation instructions below), you can preview your site locally with: make serve and go to http://0.0.0.0:4000 to preview your site. Before pushing your changes to your repository, we recommend that you also check for any potential issues with your site by running: make workshop-check Once you are satisfied with the edits to your site, commit and push the changes to your repository. A few minutes later, you can go to the GitHub Pages URL for your workshop site and preview it. In the example above, this is https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza. The finished page should look something like this. Optional but Recommended Steps Update your repository description and link your website At the top of your repository on GitHub you'll see No description, website, or topics provided. — Edit  Click 'Edit' and add:   A very brief description of your workshop in the ""Description"" box (e.g., ""Oomza University workshop, Dec. 2016"")   The URL for your workshop in the ""Website"" box (e.g., https://gvwilson.github.io/2016-12-01-oomza)   This will help people find your website if they come to your repository's home page. Update the content of the README file You can change the README.md file in your website's repository, which contains these instructions, so that it contains a short description of your workshop and a link to the workshop website. Additional Notes Note: please do all of your work in your repository's gh-pages branch, since GitHub automatically publishes that as a website. Note: this template includes some files and directories that most workshops do not need, but which provide a standard place to put extra content if desired. See the design notes for more information about these. Further instructions are available in the customization instructions. This FAQ includes a few extra tips (additions are always welcome) and these notes on the background and design of this template may help as well. Creating Extra Pages In rare cases, you may want to add extra pages to your workshop website. You can do this by putting either Markdown or HTML pages in the website's root directory and styling them according to the instructions give in the lesson template. Installing Software If you want to set up Jekyll so that you can preview changes on your own machine before pushing them to GitHub, you must install the software described in the lesson example setup instructions. Setting Up a Separate Repository for Learners If you are teaching Git, you should create a separate repository for learners to use in that lesson. You should not have them use the workshop website repository because:   your workshop website repository contains many files that most learners don't need to see during the lesson, and   you probably don't want to accidentally merge a damaging pull request from a novice Git user into your workshop's website while you are using it to teach.   You can call this repository whatever you like, and add whatever content you need to it. Getting and Giving Help We are committed to offering a pleasant setup experience for our learners and organizers. If you find bugs in our instructions, or would like to suggest improvements, please file an issue or mail us. "

Specification Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, complete the implementation of your single-page-app email client. You must fulfill the following requirements:   Send Mail: When a user submits the email composition form, add JavaScript code to actually send the email.  You’ll likely want to make a POST request to /emails, passing in values for recipients, subject, and body. Once the email has been sent, load the user’s sent mailbox.    Mailbox: When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, load the appropriate mailbox.  You’ll likely want to make a GET request to /emails/ to request the emails for a particular mailbox. When a mailbox is visited, the application should first query the API for the latest emails in that mailbox. When a mailbox is visited, the name of the mailbox should appear at the top of the page (this part is done for you). Each email should then be rendered in its own box (e.g. as a  with a border) that displays who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the      timestamp of the email. If the email is unread, it should appear with a white background. If the email has been read, it should appear with a gray background.    View Email: When a user clicks on an email, the user should be taken to a view where they see the content of that email.  You’ll likely want to make a GET request to /emails/<email_id> to request the email. Your application should show the email’s sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and body. You’ll likely want to add an additional div to inbox.html (in addition to emails-view and compose-view) for displaying the email. Be sure to update your code to hide and show the right views when navigation options are clicked. See the hint in the Hints section about how to add an event listener to an HTML element that you’ve added to the DOM. Once the email has been clicked on, you should mark the email as read. Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to update whether an email is read or not.    Archive and Unarchive: Allow users to archive and unarchive emails that they have received.  When viewing an Inbox email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them archive the email. When viewing an Archive email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them unarchive the email. This requirement does not apply to emails in the Sent mailbox. Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to mark an email as archived or unarchived. Once an email has been archived or unarchived, load the user’s inbox.    Reply: Allow users to reply to an email.  When viewing an email, the user should be presented with a “Reply” button that lets them reply to the email. When the user clicks the “Reply” button, they should be taken to the email composition form. Pre-fill the composition form with the recipient field set to whoever sent the original email. Pre-fill the subject line. If the original email had a subject line of foo, the new subject line should be Re: foo. (If the subject line already begins with Re: , no need to add it again.) Pre-fill the body of the email with a line like ""On Jan 1 2020, 12:00 AM foo@example.com wrote:"" followed by the original text of the email.      💻   View Course here ▶️   View Live Demo here   "

WhosHome is a telegram bot you can run on your local home network in order to get an answer to the question ""Who's Home?"" whenever you want. The bot does this by using nmap and parsing its output. Disclaimer I didn't find a python library that wrap nmap and will allow me complete control on the nmap command so I just parsed nmap output (I know its ugly and if someone has another option I will be happy to hear :)). This script currently works only on linux and the user running it should have sudo preveliges. How to spy on my family too? The script has a config.py file, please edit it and add the neccessary details there. The script require a bit of investigation activity in order to fill the mapping table between mac address and home member. installation The script needs to run on a unix machine connected to the home network. Steps:   Install nmap - sudo apt-get install nmap   Register a bot at telegram using the BotFather   Clone the repo   Fill the missing details in the config.py file  Enter the telegram bot token received when creating your bot. The host password (you can read the code it will use it to run nmap with sudo). Ip range to scan, example 1.1.1.0-255 will scan for all the ip addresses from 1.1.1.0 to 1.1.1.255. The mapping between a mac address and a member name. List of allowed ids - every telegram message will have the user id with it, you can receive it by sending a message to the Telegram Raw Bot.    Install deps - pip install -r requirements.txt   Optinal: tell the family about the bot and register them as valid members :)   Another disclaimer This one of my first python programs so Ill gladly take any advices and pull requests!

Знакомство с Python   Поработайте с переменными, создайте несколько, выведите на экран, запросите у пользователя несколько чисел и строк и сохраните в переменные, выведите на экран.   Пользователь вводит время в секундах. Переведите время в часы, минуты и секунды и выведите в формате чч:мм:сс. Используйте форматирование строк.   Узнайте у пользователя число n. Найдите сумму чисел n + nn + nnn. Например, пользователь ввёл число 3. Считаем 3 + 33 + 333 = 369.   Пользователь вводит целое положительное число. Найдите самую большую цифру в числе. Для решения используйте цикл while и арифметические операции.   Запросите у пользователя значения выручки и издержек фирмы. Определите, с каким финансовым результатом работает фирма (прибыль — выручка больше издержек, или убыток — издержки больше выручки). Выведите соответствующее сообщение. Если фирма отработала с прибылью, вычислите рентабельность выручки (соотношение прибыли к выручке). Далее запросите численность сотрудников фирмы и определите прибыль фирмы в расчете на одного сотрудника.   Спортсмен занимается ежедневными пробежками. В первый день его результат составил a километров. Каждый день спортсмен увеличивал результат на 10 % относительно предыдущего. Требуется определить номер дня, на который общий результат спортсмена составить не менее b километров. Программа должна принимать значения параметров a и b и выводить одно натуральное число — номер дня. Например: a = 2, b = 3. Результат: 1-й день: 2 2-й день: 2,2 3-й день: 2,42 4-й день: 2,66 5-й день: 2,93 6-й день: 3,22 Ответ: на 6-й день спортсмен достиг результата — не менее 3 км.    Урок 2. Встроенные типы и операции с ними   Создать список и заполнить его элементами различных типов данных. Реализовать скрипт проверки типа данных каждого элемента. Использовать функцию type() для проверки типа. Элементы списка можно не запрашивать у пользователя, а указать явно, в программе.   Для списка реализовать обмен значений соседних элементов, т.е. Значениями обмениваются элементы с индексами 0 и 1, 2 и 3 и т.д. При нечетном количестве элементов последний сохранить на своем месте. Для заполнения списка элементов необходимо использовать функцию input().   Пользователь вводит месяц в виде целого числа от 1 до 12. Сообщить к какому времени года относится месяц (зима, весна, лето, осень). Напишите решения через list и через dict.   Пользователь вводит строку из нескольких слов, разделённых пробелами. Вывести каждое слово с новой строки. Строки необходимо пронумеровать. Если в слово длинное, выводить только первые 10 букв в слове.   Реализовать структуру «Рейтинг», представляющую собой не возрастающий набор натуральных чисел. У пользователя необходимо запрашивать новый элемент рейтинга. Если в рейтинге существуют элементы с одинаковыми значениями, то новый элемент с тем же значением должен разместиться после них. Подсказка. Например, набор натуральных чисел: 7, 5, 3, 3, 2. Пользователь ввел число 3. Результат: 7, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2. Пользователь ввел число 8. Результат: 8, 7, 5, 3, 3, 2. Пользователь ввел число 1. Результат: 7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1. Набор натуральных чисел можно задать непосредственно в коде, например, my_list = [7, 5, 3, 3, 2].    Реализовать структуру данных «Товары». Она должна представлять собой список кортежей. Каждый кортеж хранит информацию об отдельном товаре. В кортеже должно быть два элемента — номер товара и словарь с параметрами (характеристиками товара: название, цена, количество, единица измерения). Структуру нужно сформировать программно, т.е. запрашивать все данные у пользователя. Пример готовой структуры: [ (1, {“название”: “компьютер”, “цена”: 20000, “количество”: 5, “eд”: “шт.”}), (2, {“название”: “принтер”, “цена”: 6000, “количество”: 2, “eд”: “шт.”}), (3, {“название”: “сканер”, “цена”: 2000, “количество”: 7, “eд”: “шт.”}) ] Необходимо собрать аналитику о товарах. Реализовать словарь, в котором каждый ключ — характеристика товара, например название, а значение — список значений-характеристик, например список названий товаров. Пример: { “название”: [“компьютер”, “принтер”, “сканер”], “цена”: [20000, 6000, 2000], “количество”: [5, 2, 7], “ед”: [“шт.”] }     Урок 3. Функции   Реализовать функцию, принимающую два числа (позиционные аргументы) и выполняющую их деление. Числа запрашивать у пользователя, предусмотреть обработку ситуации деления на ноль.   Реализовать функцию, принимающую несколько параметров, описывающих данные пользователя: имя, фамилия, год рождения, город проживания, email, телефон. Функция должна принимать параметры как именованные аргументы. Реализовать вывод данных о пользователе одной строкой.   Реализовать функцию my_func(), которая принимает три позиционных аргумента, и возвращает сумму наибольших двух аргументов.   Программа принимает действительное положительное число x и целое отрицательное число y. Необходимо выполнить возведение числа x в степень y. Задание необходимо реализовать в виде функции my_func(x, y). При решении задания необходимо обойтись без встроенной функции возведения числа в степень. Подсказка: попробуйте решить задачу двумя способами. Первый — возведение в степень с помощью оператора **. Второй — более сложная реализация без оператора **, предусматривающая использование цикла.   Программа запрашивает у пользователя строку чисел, разделенных пробелом. При нажатии Enter должна выводиться сумма чисел. Пользователь может продолжить ввод чисел, разделенных пробелом и снова нажать Enter. Сумма вновь введенных чисел будет добавляться к уже подсчитанной сумме. Но если вместо числа вводится специальный символ, выполнение программы завершается. Если специальный символ введен после нескольких чисел, то вначале нужно добавить сумму этих чисел к полученной ранее сумме и после этого завершить программу.   Реализовать функцию int_func(), принимающую слово из маленьких латинских букв и возвращающую его же, но с прописной первой буквой. Например, print(int_func(‘text’)) -> Text. Продолжить работу над заданием. В программу должна попадать строка из слов, разделенных пробелом. Каждое слово состоит из латинских букв в нижнем регистре. Сделать вывод исходной строки, но каждое слово должно начинаться с заглавной буквы. Необходимо использовать написанную ранее функцию int_func().    Урок 4. Полезные инструменты   Реализовать скрипт, в котором должна быть предусмотрена функция расчета заработной платы сотрудника. В расчете необходимо использовать формулу: (выработка в часах * ставка в час) + премия. Для выполнения расчета для конкретных значений необходимо запускать скрипт с параметрами.   Представлен список чисел. Необходимо вывести элементы исходного списка, значения которых больше предыдущего элемента. Подсказка: элементы, удовлетворяющие условию, оформить в виде списка. Для формирования списка использовать генератор. Пример исходного списка: [300, 2, 12, 44, 1, 1, 4, 10, 7, 1, 78, 123, 55]. Результат: [12, 44, 4, 10, 78, 123].   Для чисел в пределах от 20 до 240 найти числа, кратные 20 или 21. Необходимо решить задание в одну строку. Подсказка: использовать функцию range() и генератор.   Представлен список чисел. Определить элементы списка, не имеющие повторений. Сформировать итоговый массив чисел, соответствующих требованию. Элементы вывести в порядке их следования в исходном списке. Для выполнения задания обязательно использовать генератор. Пример исходного списка: [2, 2, 2, 7, 23, 1, 44, 44, 3, 2, 10, 7, 4, 11]. Результат: [23, 1, 3, 10, 4, 11]   Реализовать формирование списка, используя функцию range() и возможности генератора. В список должны войти четные числа от 100 до 1000 (включая границы). Необходимо получить результат вычисления произведения всех элементов списка. Подсказка: использовать функцию reduce().   Реализовать два небольших скрипта: а) итератор, генерирующий целые числа, начиная с указанного, б) итератор, повторяющий элементы некоторого списка, определенного заранее. Подсказка: использовать функцию count() и cycle() модуля itertools. Обратите внимание, что создаваемый цикл не должен быть бесконечным. Необходимо предусмотреть условие его завершения. Например, в первом задании выводим целые числа, начиная с 3, а при достижении числа 10 завершаем цикл. Во втором также необходимо предусмотреть условие, при котором повторение элементов списка будет прекращено.   Реализовать генератор с помощью функции с ключевым словом yield, создающим очередное значение. При вызове функции должен создаваться объект-генератор. Функция должна вызываться следующим образом: for el in fact(n). Функция отвечает за получение факториала числа, а в цикле необходимо выводить только первые n чисел, начиная с 1! и до n!. Подсказка: факториал числа n — произведение чисел от 1 до n. Например, факториал четырёх 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.    Урок 5. Работа с файлами   Создать программно файл в текстовом формате, записать в него построчно данные, вводимые пользователем. Об окончании ввода данных свидетельствует пустая строка.   Создать текстовый файл (не программно), сохранить в нем несколько строк, выполнить подсчет количества строк, количества слов в каждой строке.   Создать текстовый файл (не программно), построчно записать фамилии сотрудников и величину их окладов. Определить, кто из сотрудников имеет оклад менее 20 тыс., вывести фамилии этих сотрудников. Выполнить подсчет средней величины дохода сотрудников.   Создать (не программно) текстовый файл со следующим содержимым: One — 1 Two — 2 Three — 3 Four — 4 Необходимо написать программу, открывающую файл на чтение и считывающую построчно данные. При этом английские числительные должны заменяться на русские. Новый блок строк должен записываться в новый текстовый файл.   Создать (программно) текстовый файл, записать в него программно набор чисел, разделенных пробелами. Программа должна подсчитывать сумму чисел в файле и выводить ее на экран.   Необходимо создать (не программно) текстовый файл, где каждая строка описывает учебный предмет и наличие лекционных, практических и лабораторных занятий по этому предмету и их количество. Важно, чтобы для каждого предмета не обязательно были все типы занятий. Сформировать словарь, содержащий название предмета и общее количество занятий по нему. Вывести словарь на экран. Примеры строк файла: Информатика: 100(л) 50(пр) 20(лаб). Физика: 30(л) — 10(лаб) Физкультура: — 30(пр) — Пример словаря: {“Информатика”: 170, “Физика”: 40, “Физкультура”: 30}   Создать (не программно) текстовый файл, в котором каждая строка должна содержать данные о фирме: название, форма собственности, выручка, издержки. Пример строки файла: firm_1 ООО 10000 5000. Необходимо построчно прочитать файл, вычислить прибыль каждой компании, а также среднюю прибыль. Если фирма получила убытки, в расчет средней прибыли ее не включать. Далее реализовать список. Он должен содержать словарь с фирмами и их прибылями, а также словарь со средней прибылью. Если фирма получила убытки, также добавить ее в словарь (со значением убытков). Пример списка: [{“firm_1”: 5000, “firm_2”: 3000, “firm_3”: 1000}, {“average_profit”: 2000}]. Итоговый список сохранить в виде json-объекта в соответствующий файл. Пример json-объекта: [{""firm_1"": 5000, ""firm_2"": 3000, ""firm_3"": 1000}, {""average_profit"": 2000}] Подсказка: использовать менеджеры контекста.    Урок 6. Объектно-ориентированное программирование   Создать класс TrafficLight (светофор) и определить у него один атрибут color (цвет) и метод running (запуск). Атрибут реализовать как приватный. В рамках метода реализовать переключение светофора в режимы: красный, желтый, зеленый. Продолжительность первого состояния (красный) составляет 7 секунд, второго (желтый) — 2 секунды, третьего (зеленый) — на ваше усмотрение. Переключение между режимами должно осуществляться только в указанном порядке (красный, желтый, зеленый). Проверить работу примера, создав экземпляр и вызвав описанный метод. Задачу можно усложнить, реализовав проверку порядка режимов, и при его нарушении выводить соответствующее сообщение и завершать скрипт.   Реализовать класс Road (дорога), в котором определить атрибуты: length (длина), width (ширина). Значения данных атрибутов должны передаваться при создании экземпляра класса. Атрибуты сделать защищенными. Определить метод расчета массы асфальта, необходимого для покрытия всего дорожного полотна. Использовать формулу: длина * ширина * масса асфальта для покрытия одного кв метра дороги асфальтом, толщиной в 1 см * чи сло см толщины полотна. Проверить работу метода. Например: 20м * 5000м * 25кг * 5см = 12500 т   Реализовать базовый класс Worker (работник), в котором определить атрибуты: name, surname, position (должность), income (доход). Последний атрибут должен быть защищенным и ссылаться на словарь, содержащий элементы: оклад и премия, например, {""wage"": wage, ""bonus"": bonus}. Создать класс Position (должность) на базе класса Worker. В классе Position реализовать методы получения полного имени сотрудника (get_full_name) и дохода с учетом премии (get_total_income). Проверить работу примера на реальных данных (создать экземпляры класса Position, передать данные, проверить значения атрибутов, вызвать методы экземпляров).   Реализуйте базовый класс Car. У данного класса должны быть следующие атрибуты: speed, color, name, is_police (булево). А также методы: go, stop, turn(direction), которые должны сообщать, что машина поехала, остановилась, повернула (куда). Опишите несколько дочерних классов: TownCar, SportCar, WorkCar, PoliceCar. Добавьте в базовый класс метод show_speed, который должен показывать текущую скорость автомобиля. Для классов TownCar и WorkCar переопределите метод show_speed. При значении скорости свыше 60 (TownCar) и 40 (WorkCar) должно выводиться сообщение о превышении скорости. Создайте экземпляры классов, передайте значения атрибутов. Выполните доступ к атрибутам, выведите результат. Выполните вызов методов и также покажите результат.   Реализовать класс Stationery (канцелярская принадлежность). Определить в нем атрибут title (название) и метод draw (отрисовка). Метод выводит сообщение “Запуск отрисовки.” Создать три дочерних класса Pen (ручка), Pencil (карандаш), Handle (маркер). В каждом из классов реализовать переопределение метода draw. Для каждого из классов методы должен выводить уникальное сообщение. Создать экземпляры классов и проверить, что выведет описанный метод для каждого экземпляра.    Урок 7. ООП. Продвинутый уровень   Реализовать класс Matrix (матрица). Обеспечить перегрузку конструктора класса (метод init()), который должен принимать данные (список списков) для формирования матрицы. Подсказка: матрица — система некоторых математических величин, расположенных в виде прямоугольной схемы. Примеры матриц вы найдете в методичке. Следующий шаг — реализовать перегрузку метода str() для вывода матрицы в привычном виде. Далее реализовать перегрузку метода add() для реализации операции сложения двух объектов класса Matrix (двух матриц). Результатом сложения должна быть новая матрица. Подсказка: сложение элементов матриц выполнять поэлементно — первый элемент первой строки первой матрицы складываем с первым элементом первой строки второй матрицы и т.д.   Реализовать проект расчета суммарного расхода ткани на производство одежды. Основная сущность (класс) этого проекта — одежда, которая может иметь определенное название. К типам одежды в этом проекте относятся пальто и костюм. У этих типов одежды существуют параметры: размер (для пальто) и рост (для костюма). Это могут быть обычные числа: V и H, соответственно. Для определения расхода ткани по каждому типу одежды использовать формулы: для пальто (V/6.5 + 0.5), для костюма (2 * H + 0.3). Проверить работу этих методов на реальных данных. Реализовать общий подсчет расхода ткани. Проверить на практике полученные на этом уроке знания: реализовать абстрактные классы для основных классов проекта, проверить на практике работу декоратора @property.   Реализовать программу работы с органическими клетками. Необходимо создать класс Клетка. В его конструкторе инициализировать параметр, соответствующий количеству клеток (целое число). В классе должны быть реализованы методы перегрузки арифметических операторов: сложение (add()), вычитание (sub()), умножение (mul()), деление (truediv()).Данные методы должны применяться только к клеткам и выполнять увеличение, уменьшение, умножение и обычное (не целочисленное) деление клеток, соответственно. В методе деления должно осуществляться округление значения до целого числа. Сложение. Объединение двух клеток. При этом число ячеек общей клетки должно равняться сумме ячеек исходных двух клеток. Вычитание. Участвуют две клетки. Операцию необходимо выполнять только если разность количества ячеек двух клеток больше нуля, иначе выводить соответствующее сообщение. Умножение. Создается общая клетка из двух. Число ячеек общей клетки определяется как произведение количества ячеек этих двух клеток. Деление. Создается общая клетка из двух. Число ячеек общей клетки определяется как целочисленное деление количества ячеек этих двух клеток. В классе необходимо реализовать метод make_order(), принимающий экземпляр класса и количество ячеек в ряду. Данный метод позволяет организовать ячейки по рядам. Метод должен возвращать строку вида \n\n*****..., где количество ячеек между \n равно переданному аргументу. Если ячеек на формирование ряда не хватает, то в последний ряд записываются все оставшиеся. Например, количество ячеек клетки равняется 12, количество ячеек в ряду — 5. Тогда метод make_order() вернет строку: \n\n**. Или, количество ячеек клетки равняется 15, количество ячеек в ряду — 5. Тогда метод make_order() вернет строку: \n\n*****.    Урок 8. ООП. Полезные дополнения   Реализовать класс «Дата», функция-конструктор которого должна принимать дату в виде строки формата «день-месяц-год». В рамках класса реализовать два метода. Первый, с декоратором @classmethod, должен извлекать число, месяц, год и преобразовывать их тип к типу «Число». Второй, с декоратором @staticmethod, должен проводить валидацию числа, месяца и года (например, месяц — от 1 до 12). Проверить работу полученной структуры на реальных данных.   Создайте собственный класс-исключение, обрабатывающий ситуацию деления на нуль. Проверьте его работу на данных, вводимых пользователем. При вводе пользователем нуля в качестве делителя программа должна корректно обработать эту ситуацию и не завершиться с ошибкой.   Создайте собственный класс-исключение, который должен проверять содержимое списка на наличие только чисел. Проверить работу исключения на реальном примере. Необходимо запрашивать у пользователя данные и заполнять список. Класс-исключение должен контролировать типы данных элементов списка. Примечание: длина списка не фиксирована. Элементы запрашиваются бесконечно, пока пользователь сам не остановит работу скрипта, введя, например, команду “stop”. При этом скрипт завершается, сформированный список выводится на экран. Подсказка: для данного задания примем, что пользователь может вводить только числа и строки. При вводе пользователем очередного элемента необходимо реализовать проверку типа элемента и вносить его в список, только если введено число. Класс-исключение должен не позволить пользователю ввести текст (не число) и отобразить соответствующее сообщение. При этом работа скрипта не должна завершаться.   Начните работу над проектом «Склад оргтехники». Создайте класс, описывающий склад. А также класс «Оргтехника», который будет базовым для классов-наследников. Эти классы — конкретные типы оргтехники (принтер, сканер, ксерокс). В базовом классе определить параметры, общие для приведенных типов. В классах-наследниках реализовать параметры, уникальные для каждого типа оргтехники.   Продолжить работу над первым заданием. Разработать методы, отвечающие за приём оргтехники на склад и передачу в определенное подразделение компании. Для хранения данных о наименовании и количестве единиц оргтехники, а также других данных, можно использовать любую подходящую структуру, например словарь.   Продолжить работу над вторым заданием. Реализуйте механизм валидации вводимых пользователем данных. Например, для указания количества принтеров, отправленных на склад, нельзя использовать строковый тип данных. Подсказка: постарайтесь по возможности реализовать в проекте «Склад оргтехники» максимум возможностей, изученных на уроках по ООП.   Реализовать проект «Операции с комплексными числами». Создайте класс «Комплексное число», реализуйте перегрузку методов сложения и умножения комплексных чисел. Проверьте работу проекта, создав экземпляры класса (комплексные числа) и выполнив сложение и умножение созданных экземпляров. Проверьте корректность полученного результата.   "

Each entry can be viewed by visiting that entry’s page. Specification These are the specifications given to me in the course CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:   Entry Page: Visiting /wiki/TITLE, where TITLE is the title of an encyclopedia entry, should render a page that displays the contents of that encyclopedia entry. The view should get the content of the encyclopedia entry by calling the appropriate util function.  If an entry is requested that does not exist, the user should be presented with an error page indicating that their requested page was not found. If the entry does exist, the user should be presented with a page that displays the content of the entry. The title of the page should include the name of the entry.    Index Page: Update index.html such that, instead of merely listing the names of all pages in the encyclopedia, user can click on any entry name to be taken directly to that entry page.   Search: Allow the user to type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry.  If the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should be redirected to that entry’s page. If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should instead be taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring. For example, if the search query were Py, then Python should appear in the search results. Clicking on any of the entry names on the search results page should take the user to that entry’s page.    New Page: Clicking “Create New Page” in the sidebar should take the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry.  Users should be able to enter a title for the page and, in a textarea, should be able to enter the Markdown content for the page. Users should be able to click a button to save their new page. When the page is saved, if an encyclopedia entry already exists with the provided title, the user should be presented with an error message. Otherwise, the encyclopedia entry should be saved to disk, and the user should be taken to the new entry’s page.    Edit Page: On each entry page, the user should be able to click a link to be taken to a page where the user can edit that entry’s Markdown content in a textarea.  The textarea should be pre-populated with the existing Markdown content of the page. (i.e., the existing content should be the initial value of the textarea). The user should be able to click a button to save the changes made to the entry. Once the entry is saved, the user should be redirected back to that entry’s page.    Random Page: Clicking “Random Page” in the sidebar should take user to a random encyclopedia entry.   Markdown to HTML Conversion: On each entry’s page, any Markdown content in the entry file should be converted to HTML before being displayed to the user. You may use the python-markdown2 package to perform this conversion, installable via pip3 install markdown2.   💻   View Course here ▶️   View Live Demo here

417565103;OriScapy;https://github.com/orishamir/OriScapy;Python;2021-10-15T16:22:32Z;0;0;0;"OriScapy This is a custom-made version of the well known Scapy library for python. Rationale In my journey of learning about the fascinating world, I realised that Scapy is something im using all the time, without needing to worry about all the stuff it does in the background, automatically. For example, when crafting an ARP request: pkt = Ether()/ARP(pdst=""<Get_This_IP's_Mac"") mac = srp1(pkt)[ARP].hwsrc Scapy automatically fills a good deal of fields of the ARP header. for example, you don't have to worry about these fields:   hwtype, ptype, hwlen, plen, op, hwsrc, psrc, hwdst, pdst        Which Scapy automatically fills according to the RFC Specification / ARP packet header Also, no parameters were given to the Ether class constructor, although the Ethernet header obviously contains some info: dst, src, type  All those fields are automatically completed by scapy for your own comfort, Scapy automatically detects the type of packet to be sent is ARP, And so it sets the type field to 0x806, like it should be. Also, the Source MAC and the Destination MAC are automatically filled. And so I wanted for my knowledge about Networking, to learn more about each of the most famous packet's header format. And to do that I thought to make my own Scapy which would support Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP (ping) and maybe more in the future. "

Built With  Python Flask Flask-Babel  Getting Started These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. Prerequisites All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file requirements.txt. Installation  Git clone or download the project files  git clone https://github.com/hazzillrodriguez/flask-multi-language.git  Create and activate the virtual environment  cd flask-multi-language python -m venv env source env/Scripts/activate  Install requirements  pip install -r requirements.txt   Set the environment variables  export FLASK_APP=run.py export FLASK_ENV=development  Start the development web server  flask run  Usage Open config.py and add your own supported languages. class BaseConfig(object):     # Here you can list all the languages ​​that you want to use in your application     LANGUAGES = {         'en': 'English',         'zh': 'Chinese',         'de': 'German'     } If you need to be more specific, a country code can be added as well. For example, you could use en-US, en-GB, and en-CA to support American, British, and Canadian English as different languages. Mark all the texts that need translations in the source code. Marking Texts to Translate In Templates The way you will communicate to Babel that you want something translated in your templates will be by using the following format (parentheses preceded by an underscore). <h1>{{ _('Hello world!') }}</h1> <div>{{ form.email(placeholder=_('user@example.com')) }}</div> <input type=""text"" id=""email"" name=""email"" placeholder={{ _('Email address') }}>  Additionally, if you want to use constant strings somewhere in your application and define them outside of a request, you can use a lazy strings. Lazy strings will not be evaluated until they are actually used. To use such a lazy string, use the lazy_gettext() function: from flask_babel import lazy_gettext  class MyForm(FlaskForm): 	email = StringField(lazy_gettext('Email'), validators=[DataRequired()]) Marking Texts to Translate In Python Source Code Flask uses gettext together with Babel. The idea of gettext is that you can mark certain strings as translatable and a tool will pick all those up, collect them in a separate file for you to translate. from flask_babel import gettext  flash(gettext('Your email or password is incorrect!')) Commands There is no need to remember long and complicated commands. To add a new language, you use: (env) $ flask translate init <language-code>  To update all the languages after making changes to the _(), gettext(), and lazy_gettext() language markers: (env) $ flask translate update  And to compile all languages after updating the translation files: (env) $ flask translate compile  License Distributed under the MIT License.

For a list of the snippets and their descriptions, also go to the GitHub Page associated with this project. Table of Contents  Motivation New to scripting in PyMOL Tech Stack Installation Configuration Setup Usage Testing Requests for new snippets and text editors Bug reports Roadmaps License Contact Information How to cite  Motivations for this project Use taggedpymolpysnips to be more productive while running PyMOL in Jupyterlab with the elyra-code-snippets-extension The animation below demonstrates the use of the ao snippet in taggedpymolpysnips to insert 17 lines of code for generating the ambient occlusion effect.  The snippet will appear in a list of autosuggestions after entering the first several letters of its tab trigger.  Note that entering ao was not sufficient to bring up the ao snippet.  I had to enter aod to bring up the ao snippet in the list.  The animation below shows the use of Knitr to convert the Rmarkdown document into a PDF file.  The result of applying a variant of the above code to a 27-nucleotide RNA hairpin is shown below.  There is no option in a pulldown menu in PyMOL to apply the ambient occlusion effect. A script file with 17 commands is required. This code can be applied to any molecular object that has been loaded into PyMOL. Return to Table of Contents Why run PyMOL in JupyterLab? 1. JupyterLab is very easy to use. The code cells are easy to execute and edit with help from the menu pull-downs. The keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter are modest in number and fast to master. 2. Illustrate JupyterLab with molecular images You can illustrate your JupyterLab documents with images created in PyMOL. You can also adjust molecular images from within JupyterLab without having to open PyMOL, thereby saving time. 3. Jupyter notebooks are easy to edit in JupyterLab  The Jupyter notebooks have a gentle learning curve because they are easy to edit. The code blocks can be run individually during the development of the code or all of the code block can be run at once. 4. Combine PyMOL output with statistical packages The output from structure analysis can be directly imported into statistical for further analysis. The presence of output from PyMOL and statistical packages in the same document eases the tracking of the results and supports reproducible research. 5. Streamlines the management of images for a project The images generated by PyMOL can be stored in one Jupyter notebook file as opposed to having dozens of script and images files sequestered in numerous subfolders. The use of one file greatly eases finding the code to make a particular figure because the code and image can be next to each other.  This ability to easily find the required code at a later time reduces the resistance to remaking a figure for manuscript resubmission, journal cover artwork, posters, platform presentations, lectures, book chapters, review articles, websites, and wall hangings. The use of one file also eases the sharing of images with collaborators because only one file needs to be shared. If the collaborators are not PyMOL or JupyterLab users, the notebook file can be reformatted as a PDF or HTML file. 6. Facilitates combining PyMOL with other software in molecular structure analysis Other software can be run from the same notebook during a molecular structure analysis project provided that this software has Python APIs. This can improve the reproducibility of the computational aspects of your research. Return to Table of Contents But I will miss the interactive viewport in PyMOL!   You can run the PyMOL GUI next to your JupyterLab session. You can adjust the molecule's orientation manually, run the get_view command, and copy the output in the command history window from PyMOL and paste it into a cell in the Jupyter notebook. The one line of settings returned by the rv shortcut is much easier to work with (see PyMOL shortcuts).   You do not need the viewport. With 10-15 minutes of practice, you can master the rapid iterating of rotate and translate commands to adjust the molecule's orientation with greater precision than via manipulation of the mouse.   Return to Table of Contents New to PyMOL scripting? If you are not ready to write PyMOL scripts, please consider using PyMOL shortcuts to enhance your productivity in PyMOL interactive sessions. For example, the above ambient occlusion effect can be invoked at any time by entering AO at the PyMOL prompt, if the pymolshortcuts.py file has been loaded. These shortcuts can also be invoked in JupyterLab by submitting them as arguments to the cmd.do() method, (e.g., cmd.do(""AO"") to generate the ambient occlusion effect.) Application Description The taggedpymolpysnips library contains 260 code fragments (i.e, templates or snippets) written in Python to run PyMOL in JupyterLab via PyMOL's Python API through the reticulate package. This API is only available for recent versions of PyMOL that depend on Python3 from Anaconda. This API is available for both the incentive and open-source versions of PyMOL. A conda env with Python 3.8 or later as the default Python interpreter is required. PyMOL must be installed in this env. Return to Table of Contents Technology Stack    Technology Version Description     PyMOL 2.5.1 Molecular graphics program   Python from Anaconda 3.6-3.9 Programming language   conda from Anaconda 4.10.1 Program used to create Python environments.   git 2.25.1 Eases the downloading and updating of the libraries.    Some of the snippets are limited to Python3 code. If you are using an ancient version of PyMOL that relies on Python2, you can buy a license to the current version of PyMOL, install a free open-source version of PyMOL that depends on Python3 (See the PyMOL Wiki), or you can rewrite the snippet's code to be Python2 compliant. This often merely involves replacing print functions in Python3 with print statements in Python2. Note that multiple versions of PyMOL can operate side-by-side on a computer, so you do not have to delete the old version of PyMOL. Installation of the snippet library # If the following directory is missing: ~/.config/rstudio/snippets mkdir ~/Library/Jupyter/metadata cd ~/Library/Jupyter/metadata git clone https://github.com/MooersLab/elyrapymolpysnips.git snippets When you open JupyterLab, you will find that the new file python.snippets from rstudiopymolpysnips has replaced the default Python snippets. These are found under Preferences/Code/Edit Snippets/Python (see animation below). You can edit the snippets and add new ones. The format is self-explanatory.  Return to Table of Contents Configuration Setup The snippet library is independent of PyMOL. No modification of PyMOL is required.

Puntualmente, se debe predecir la variable damage_grade que representa el nivel de daño recibido por la edificación. El error de la solución se calculará con la métrica F1 Score, particularmente con la variación no binaria micro averaged F1 score. Podríamos pensar que una opción alternativa de métrica para el error sería promediar los F1 Score individuales de cada clasificación. El promedio de eso nos daría una métrica llamada macro-F1-score, que daría igual relevancia a todas los F1-score por igual sin importar su peso en la estimación. Ej: supongamos que F1-grade-1 = 50%; F1-grade-2 = 62% y F1-grade-3 = 34%. Macro-F1 = 48,66% La alternativa utilizada para el ejercicio,  micro-F1-score,  pone más énfasis en los labels más comunes logrando de esta manera que aquellos labels poco comunes no afecten a la métrica general. Se deja el siguiente paper para aquellos interesados en leer con más profundidad al respecto. El ejercicio se desarrollará en el contexto de una competencia de Driven Data. Para esto deben tener dos conjuntos de datos: El de entrenamiento Train Values con sus respectivos labels Train Labels, sobre el cual ajustarán su/s modelo/s junto con sus hiperparámetros. El de test Test Values, sobre el cual realizarán predicciones y subirán los resultados a Driven Data. El score estará dado por la ecuación anterior. También contarán con un modelo de submission que deberán respetar. Trabajo esperado Se espera que armen un pipeline completo de machine learning experimentando en cada etapa. Esto quiere decir: Realizar feature engineering, encontrando codificaciones que sirvan, generando nuevos atributos, analizando cuáles atributos aportan y cuáles no. Probar modelos predictivos que crean que se encuadran al problema. Esto puede incluir realización de ensambles, también. Búsqueda de hiperparámetros óptimos de alguna manera automatizada. Como sugerencia, recomendamos realizar una primera versión de cada etapa y que luego vayan en profundidad en cada una. Además de los aspectos funcionales del código, también esperamos que trabajen de manera científica. Esto implica: Plantear preguntas o hipótesis y responderlas con experimentos y resultados. Las cosas no se hacen por que sí; debe haber una motivación basada en el conocimiento. Trabajo en equipo. Entendemos que la virtualidad y la asincronía complican la comunicación, pero en cualquier trabajo científico, en particular en los trabajos de aprendizaje automático, es fundamental la difusión de conocimiento entre las personas. Esto evita la redundancia de experimentos, genera un trabajo más cohesivo y hace que cada integrante tenga una visión más completa del problema. Realizar un poco de investigación del problema. En los apuntes de la materia, en las bibliotecas del lenguaje que utilizan, en internet. Esto no implica probar cosas a mansalva y sin criterio -- como mencionamos antes, debe haber una motivación o justificación. Interpretación de los resultados. Una vez que se realiza un experimento hay que considerar si funcionó como fue esperado o no y por qué. Los resultados negativos también son resultados. Es parte de la interpretación entender el problema en específico y encuadrar bien la solución. Presentación. Cualquier trabajo en ingeniería o ciencia requiere de una presentación a los colegas. Como pares de ustedes, esperamos que la comunicación que hagan del proceso y de los resultados se sustente en argumentos, datos y gráficos. "

Once the user has selected the type of conversion required, the program queries the user for a temperature input, and then converts the temperature to the desired unit and displays the result with a precision of two decimal places.  The program repeats until the user chooses not to.

In the UV code, it plots the UV absorption spectra and simulate the low-energy part which is believed to attribute to the aggregates of P3HT. The ratio of extinction coefficients of aggregate and non-aggregate phase could be calculated from the differences of the spectra when the temperature changes. Thus, the percent of aggregates in the solid-state P3HT films could be calculated by integrating FC analysis and extinction coefficients.

417643038;IBSNtools;https://github.com/vsjoen/IBSNtools;Python;2021-10-15T21:36:08Z;0;0;0;"IBSNtools  Description IBSNtools is a set of tools for analyzing image ballistics in social networks written in Python. These tools can be used to organize and compare images uploaded to various social networks to the original image files. The view tool will display whether or not the image data has been modified after being uploaded to a social network. IBSNview analyzes whether or not the images have been re-named, re-sized or re-compressed. It also analyzes whether or not EXIF data has been stripped or modified. Quantization tables and EXIF data for the images can be viewed, and the data can also be exported to CSV format for further analysis. Prerequisites This program requires Python 3.x as well as the following libraries:  opencv_contrib_python piexif numpy Pillow  Installation Run pip from the main folder to install requirements. pip install -r requirements.txt  Known issues  Clicking next image too fast on Linux may cause the program to freeze. Some of the EXIF data is encoded in byte format and therefore not human-readable.  How to use After installing prerequisites and organizing your image files, run IBSNview.py to start the program. Folder structure In order for the GUI-tool to work, the images have to adhere to a certain folder structure. There should be one parent folder that contains sub-folders named after the cameras used to take the photos. In the camera folders, there should be one folder for each original photo taken by the camera. Inside the image folder, there should be exactly one image file (the original photo), as well as one sub-folder for each social network you have uploaded the original image to. Inside the social network folders there should be exactly one image that was uploaded and downloaded from the respective social network platform.  imageFolder ├── CANON_650D_720X480_INDOOR │   ├── IMG_2635 │   │   ├── IMG_2635.JPG │   │   ├── facebook │   │   │   └── 1.jpg │   │   ├── flickr │   │   │   └── 26204266014_76ce7dd748_b.jpg │   │   ├── google+ │   │   │   └── IMG_2635.jpg │   │   ├── imgur │   │   │   └── 01\ -\ 3POgMpm.jpg │   │   ├── instagram │   │   │   └── 12818938_1140129992698752_861157192_n.jpg │   │   ├── telegram │   │   │   └── 422116736_16288720980252527992.jpg │   │   ├── tinypic │   │   │   └── 34fgw8i.jpg │   │   ├── tumblr │   │   │   └── tumblr_o3q9e2zuH21vnf44lo1_1280.jpg │   │   ├── twitter │   │   │   └── Cdp0SEgWwAAJQd8.jpg │   │   └── whatsapp │   │       └── IMG-20160314-WA0011.jpg │   └── IMG_2636 │       ├── IMG_2636.JPG │       ├── facebook │       │   └── 2.jpg │       ├── flickr │       │   └── 26204266044_51bbb1f152_b.jpg │       ├── google+ │       │   └── IMG_2636.jpg │       ├── imgur │       │   └── 02\ -\ i7JYrol.jpg │       ├── instagram │       │   └── 12783835_452031228326433_1890673980_n.jpg │       ├── telegram │       │   └── 421222168_1084613614143026389.jpg │       ├── tinypic │       │   └── 262ky84.jpg │       ├── tumblr │       │   └── tumblr_o3q9e2zuH21vnf44lo2_1280.jpg │       ├── twitter │       │   └── Cdp0SH4XIAEVkBC.jpg │       └── whatsapp │           └── IMG-20160314-WA0010.jpg ├── SAMSUNG_NOTE3_NEO_3264X2448_INDOOR │   └── 20150213_134949 │       ├── 20150213_134949.jpg │       ├── facebook │       │   └── 4.jpg │       ├── flickr │       │   └── 26785067056_1e92ac59e0_h.jpg │       ├── google+ │       │   └── 20150213_134949.jpg │       ├── imgur │       │   └── 04\ -\ hrijZwh.jpg │       ├── instagram │       │   └── 10616644_224825451205119_1162687156_n.jpg │       ├── telegram │       │   └── 421211778_7609660349885752490.jpg │       ├── tinypic │       │   └── etw8kj.jpg │       ├── tumblr │       │   └── tumblr_o3qaitLYaa1vnf44lo8_1280.jpg │       ├── twitter │       │   └── CdqHTrwWAAA0IUm.jpg │       └── whatsapp │           └── 8.jpg └── SONY_POWERSHOT_A2300_4608X3456_OUTDOOR_NATURAL     └── IMG_9058         ├── IMG_9058.JPG         ├── facebook         │   └── 1.jpg         ├── flickr         │   └── 26741407941_760737c219_h.jpg         ├── google+         │   └── IMG_9058.jpg         ├── imgur         │   └── 01\ -\ WgE4eVV.jpg         ├── instagram         │   └── 1169337_1580090438985059_1840711599_n.jpg         ├── telegram         │   └── 421932970_1868051944404017215.jpg         ├── tinypic         │   └── 30kznsy.jpg         ├── tumblr         │   └── tumblr_o415wcLUAA1vnf44lo10_1280.jpg         ├── twitter         │   └── Cdp-mPDWAAAcRli.jpg         └── whatsapp             └── 5.jpg  Automatically Sort Images You can use the IBSNsort.py script to automatically sort your downloaded image files. In a parent folder, create one folder called ""unsorted"" and one folder called ""sorted"". Ensure that your original image files follow the folder structure of camera folder -> image folder -> image, then move the camera folders you want to use into the ""sorted"" folder. In the ""unsorted"" folder, create one folder for each social network you have downloaded images from, then place all the photos from each social network in their respective folders. Now you should be able to run the IBSNsort.py script to automatically sort the images. python3 IBSNsort.py sortFolder  Before sorting: sortFolder ├── sorted │   ├── CANON_650D_720X480_INDOOR │   │   └── IMG_2636 │   │       ├── IMG_2636.JPG │   ├── SAMSUNG_NOTE3_NEO_3264X2448_INDOOR │   │   └── 20150213_134949 │   │       ├── 20150213_134949.jpg │   └── SONY_POWERSHOT_A2300_4608X3456_OUTDOOR_NATURAL │       └── IMG_9058 │           ├── IMG_9058.JPG └── unsorted     └── facebook         ├── 1.jpg         ├── 2.jpg         └── 4.jpg  After sorting: sortFolder ├── sorted │   ├── CANON_650D_720X480_INDOOR │   │   └── IMG_2636 │   │       ├── IMG_2636.JPG │   │       └── facebook │   │           └── 2.jpg │   ├── SAMSUNG_NOTE3_NEO_3264X2448_INDOOR │   │   └── 20150213_134949 │   │       ├── 20150213_134949.jpg │   │       └── facebook │   │           └── 4.jpg │   └── SONY_POWERSHOT_A2300_4608X3456_OUTDOOR_NATURAL │       └── IMG_9058 │           ├── IMG_9058.JPG │           └── facebook │               └── 1.jpg └── unsorted     └── facebook         ├── 1.jpg         ├── 2.jpg         └── 4.jpg  Viewing Image Data After your images are sorted, you can run IBSNview.py to browse through the images and their data. python3 IBSNview.py  Exporting Image Data After your images are sorted and everything looks good in IBSNview, you can run IBSNexport.py to export the data to a CSV file.  python3 IBSNexport.py imageFolder fileName.csv  imageFolder is the folder containing your sorted images, and fileName.csv is the name of the output file.

Instructions Just download the ZIP file, extract it and run HorseRace.py from the terminal with $ python3 HorseRace.py  From there, just follow the instructions on screen and you will be good to go! If there are any missing libraries (very unlikely, since the game only uses a couple), you can install them with: $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt  Game Principle Everytime a new race starts, the game creates 10 horses and randomly generates two attributes for each one:  Speed (Between 2 and 12): The amount of spaces a horse can move in a single time step; Energy (Between 0 and 10): The amount of moves a horse can make before it gets tired.  After that, all horses go to the starting line and the race happens following the loop:  All horses move according to their speed; All horses lose 1 point of energy; If a horse becomes tired (Energy = 0), it loses half of its speed for the rest of the race;  Steps 1, 2 and 3 are repeated until one of the horses reaches the finish line.

417576641;PasswordManager;https://github.com/Sufyaan323/PasswordManager;;2021-10-15T17:04:44Z;0;0;0;PasswordManager A Python project which uses SQLite to create and store usernames and passwords, as well as the website name.  Research Needed:  How does a password manager works? How does hashing work? Is there any extensions I need to use to allow Python to interact with the SQLlite database?   Research Results:  There are 3 main types of password managers:  Offline - The passwords are stored locally Online - The passwords are stored on a remote server Token-based / Stateless - A physical hardware, such as a USB, which contains a key to unlock a user's account    I will be creating an offline password manager which will first hash and maybe even salt passwords before inputting them into the SQL database i will create with SQLite, a serverless database.

This 'Token Farm' holds compatible tokens from users, and can pay out in its own token based on the price in USD of the users' holdings, determined through Chainlink's price feeds. The contract deployments are handled with Brownie and written in Python, while the front-end interface is done with React programming in Typescript. If downloading and running this code yourself, make sure to install the node module dependencies. Although the video tutorial was used as reference, no code was actually copied from their provided repositories. The brownie-config.yaml file is very barebones, as this work was only tested on a Ganache chain. Deploying to a blockchain that exists beyond your local machine, either to a test network such as Kovan or Rinkeby, or a more real blockchain with real money (or money-equivalent) involved, will require some additional code to handle and reference existing token and price feed contracts. The front end website works with the MetaMask browser extension, which is required to interact with it.

417586065;elm-android-app;https://github.com/leforestier/elm-android-app;Python;2021-10-15T17:40:47Z;0;0;0;" Requirements  You need to have installed:  the Android SDK Elm Python git     Starting a project Simply clone this repo and then cd into it.  Build script The script that enables you to build and/or install the app onto the device is manage.py. It's a single Python script without any dependencies. You can call it like this on the command line: $ python manage.py (see next section for commands available)  On Linux you should be able to do simply: $ ./manage.py (see next section for commands available)   To build an Elm application (running in a webview)  Keystore First, and this is something  you only have to do once per project, create a debug Android keystore using the command: $ ./manage.py create-debug-key  This create a keystore in the current directory under the file name debug.keystore.  Environment variables You need to supply three environment variables to the script: - BUILD_TOOLS_DIR: the directory of the Android SDK where reside tools such as `aapt` and `dx`.   For example, I use `BUILD_TOOLS_DIR=/home/myusername/Android/Sdk/build-tools/29.0.0/`  - PLATFORM_DIR: the directory of the Android SDK where reside `android.jar`.   For example I use `PLATFORM_DIR=/home/myusername/Android/Sdk/platforms/android-29/`  - KEYSTORE_FILE: the keystore file. If you created it by `manage.py create-debug-keystore`,   then the file is `debug.keystore` and you should use `KEYSTORE_FILE=debug.keystore`  The rest of this tutorial assume you have exported these 3 environment variables using: $ export BUILD_TOOLS_DIR=... PLATFORM_DIR=... KEYSTORE_FILE=...   Build the apk Build an apk with the command: $ ./manage.py build  The apk is created inside the build directory.  Install the app on an Android device Make sure your device is connected to your computer in debug mode (you can use the command adb devices to check if your device appear in the list). Then: $ ./manage.py install  You can also install the app and start it automatically using: $ ./manage.py install+run   Changing the name of the application You change the name of the application exactly like you would in a normal Java only android application. The name displayed in the icon list of the device is the name you find in the AndroidManifest.xml in the android:label attribute of the application tag. We've used ""Elm App"" as an example. You can change the package name from the original example we've used (com.example.elmwebviewapp) to what you like (say net.birdwatchers.birdspot) by renaming the directories java/com/example/elmwebviewapp to java/net/birdwatchers/birdspot, then replace the first line package com.example.elmwebviewapp; in MainActivity.java with package net.birdwatchers.birdspot;. Then replace the package=""com.example.elmwebviewapp"" manifest attribute in AndroidManifest.xml with package=""net.birdwatchers.birdspot""  Changing the icon of the application Same as with a normal Java only android application. Refer to Android development documentation.  Viewing the app in the browser using elm-live Before loading the app on the device, you can develop using elm-live and see your changes in the browser of your laptop/desktop. This requires to have installed elm-live. Then: $ ./manage.py elm-live  This is just a shortcut for: $ elm-live src/Main.elm -d assets -- --output=assets/main.js  "

The input.py sends user input direction and speed entered using keyboard and converts it into motor direction (forward or reverse) and speed (0 to 255) In this project, the objective was to create two files (input.py and server.py) to control a 4 wheel rover. The input.py recieved input from the user using keyword and it was sent over to the server.py over the network to control the rover using Python programming language. The files and their implementation are mentioned below input.py implementation: input.py file is the file that takes the user input from the keyboard and sends it over the network to the server.py. The input.py accepts values from 0 to 5 to control the speed of the rove and accepts W, S, A, and D keys to control the rovers direction. In order to accept user input, ""pygame"" library was imported into the file so that its library could be used to decode which keys are pressed. Also, for network connection, ""socket"" was also imported. Before we get into the code, the pygame library and the network connection must be initalized: In order to use pygames library, ""pygame.init()"" must be called to initalize pygame for execution. Next, in order to set up a network between input.py and server.py, socket library's socket.socket function is called to initialize the iPv4 and TCP connections. Furthermore, the client (input.py) must connect to the server (server.py). To establish the connect, connect function was used to establish connection using the host connection name and a port number. For this project. ""socket.gethostname()"" function was called to connect to the host computers network and port number 5000 was chosen at random since the lower ports are already in use by other programs on the computer. To use pygame, a small display screen of 800x600 was also initialized. The screen is an interface that must be clicked in order for the program to accept input. It is a black screen that displays nothing. The commands that the code executes get displayed in the terminal instead. A speed variable is also initialzed to zero so that the robot is initally at rest and the speed must be manually changed. Now to the code: In the  ""if name == 'main':"", the first two lines are a welcome message and an introduction message to let the user know what the program is about. After the message, input.py goes into an infinite loop which starts to handle events. Events are triggered every time a key is pressed. In this infinite while loop, the program executes the events for all the 9 possible inputs the user can enter. ""for event in pygame.event.get():"" is a for loop that calls pygame.event.get() to see if any event has been triggered (if any button is pressed). The first if-condition in the for-loop looks for if the display screen has been close. If it has, the loop condition becomes false and input.py exits The second if-condition in the for-loop checks if a button-pressed type of event has been triggered. (pygame.KEYDOWN). If a button is pressed, then it checks for which 1 of the 9 buttons has been pressed.  if 0 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 0 if 1 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 1 if 2 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 2 if 3 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 3 if 4 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 4 if 5 has been pressed, then set the ""speed"" variable to 5  For the W,A,S,and D keys, the if-condition is different. When they are pressed, instead of setting a variable, we send the speed and the respective direction to the server.py. The reason why we must send it when W,A,S, and D are pressed is because we have all the information to direct the rover. If W,A,S,and D are pressed before setting the rover speed, the speed by default is set to zero hence, we still have enough information to direct the rover. Except, when speed = 0, no matter which direction is pressed, the robot doesn't move. Therefore, if A has been pressed, send the speed information first over the network (in a string format) followed by the character ""A"" Similarly, for S,W,and D, the speed variable is also sent first followed by character ""S"", ""W"", and ""D"" when their respective keys are pressed.

Ela não contém replay nem reset, de forma que o jogo não pode retroceder. Para versão mais complexa, acesse a branch diversao Projeto para Ensino de Programação Orientadas a Objetos em Python. A versão utilizada para desenvolvimento foi Python 3.4 Um vídeo fala mais que 1000 palavras: Python Birds Contribuidores  Giovane Liberato Guido Luz Michel Amaral Renzo Nuccitelli  Abordagem Instalar Python 3. Baixar o zip do projeto (botão Download Zip) Os testes se encontram dentro do pacote ""testes"" e servem para definir a dinâmica das classes. Para rodar todos testes, execute: python executor_de_testes.py  Explicação detalhada sobre classes e métodos se encontram nos scripts atores.py e fase.py. Ordem de desenvolvimento A ordem preferida é começar pelos atores, seguindo a ordem dos testes presentes no script atores_testes.py. Depois passar para a fase_teste.py, onde é implementada uma fase. É possível emular um jogo que termina em vitória rodando: python fase_testes.py  É possível jogar a fase rodando: python placa_grafica_tkinter.py  Para jogar, utilize as setas para cima e para baixo. Para lançar, utilize a tecla enter ou espaço. Demonstração nos vídeos: Python Birds script atores.py Contém todos atores do projeto. script fase.py Contém classes respectivas a fase e ponto do plano cartesiano script placa_grafica.py Contém lógica para rodar jogo e exibir no console. script placa_grafica_tkinter.py Contém lógica para rodar jogo em uma janela. Simplificação do Jogo  Atores são pontos no plano cartesiano. A velocidade dos pontos é pequena, de tal forma que a cada passo os atores se movam apenas para pontos vizinhos. A colisão entre pontos ocorre quando eles estão em ponto vizinho, de acordo com valor de intervalo.  A seguir é apresentada a especificação detalhada do jogo. Classe Ator Classe base para todos atores do jogo. Método calcular_posicao Método que recebe o tempo (float) como parâmetro e retorna uma tupla com 2 elementos, posição horizontal (x) como primeiro elemento e posição vertical (y) como segundo. Método colidir O método colidir executa a lógica de colisão. A colisão só ocorre com atores ativos e que estejam em pontos vizinhos. Ao colidir, os atores envolvidos devem ter seus status alterado para DESTRUIDO Classe Obstaculo Classe que representa obstáculos na fase e que podem ser destruídos por pássaros. Herda de ator. Seu caracter de representação é a letra ""O"", quando ATIVO. Status Um obstáculo ao ter seu status alterado para DESTRUIDO deve ter seu caracter de apresentação alterado para "" "" (vazio). Assim ele vai ""sumir"" da tela. Classe Porco Classe que representa porcos na fase e que podem ser destruídos por pássaros. Herda de ator. Seu caracter de representação é a o caracter ""@"". Status Um obstáculo ao ter seu status alterado para DESTRUIDO deve ter seu caracter de apresentação alterado para ""+"" (sinal de mais). Assim sua imagem é alterada para a de porco morto. Passaro Classe base de todos os passáros. Cada tipo possui uma velocidade de lançamento (v). No lançamento o jogador escolhe o ângulo (teta), em graus, no qual o passáro deve ser lançado. O lançamento respeita as regras de lançamento oblíquo com gravidade (GRAVIDADE) constante e igual a 10 m/s^2. Método lancar O método lançar recebe o ângulo, em graus, que será feito o lançamento. Ele deve ser convertido para radianos. Cada pássaro deve armazenar esse valor e o tempo de lançamento para cálculo de sua posíção. Lembrar que o tempo das fórmulas é delta_t = T_final - T_inicial. Método de colidir_com_chao Todo pássaro que colidir com o chão (y<=0) deve ser destruído. Método foi_lançado Esse método deve retornar verdadadeiro se o pássaro foi lançado (tempo de lançamento é None). Caso contrário deve retornar falso. Lançamento Se o pássaro ainda não foi lançado, o pássaro deve permanecer na posição inicial. Caso tenha sido lançado e seu status esteja ATIVO, sua posição deve ser calculada de acordo com o lançamento oblíquo. Nesse caso, delta_t vai ser igual ao tempo do jogo menos o tempo do lançamento. Caso contrário, ele deve retornar a posição onde colidiu. Método posicao_horizontal Fórmula X=X0+v*cos(teta)*delta_t. Método posicao_vertical Fórmula Y=Y0+v*sen(teta)delta_t-(G*delta_t^2)/2. Classe Passaro Vermelho Tipo de Pássaro que representa o pássaro vermelho. Possui velocidade de lançamento igual a 20 m/s. Seu caracter quanto ATIVO é ""V"". Quando DESTRUIDO é ""v"". Classe Passaro Amarelo Tipo de Pássaro que representa o pássaro amarelo. Possui velocidade de lançamento igual a 30 m/s. Seu caracter quanto DESTRUIDO é ""a"". Classe Fase Classe responsável por organizar atores e transformar os dados em pontos a serem representados na tela. Método adicionar_obstaculo Método que adiciona um ou mais obstáculos na fase. Método adicionar_porco Método que adiciona um ou mais porcos na fase. Método adicionar_passaro Método que adiciona um ou mais pássaros na fase. Método status Recebe o tempo como parâmetro e retorna status do jogo.  Se o jogo está em andamento, retorna status ""EM_ANDAMENTO""; Se o jogo acabou e não existem porcos ativos, retorna STATUS ""VITORIA""; Se o jogo acabou e existem porcos ativos, retorna status ""DERROTA"".  Método lancar Recebe o ângulo e o tempo do lançamento. Deve delegar o lançamento ao primeiro pássaro ATIVO da lista de pássaros que ainda não foi lançado. Método calcular_pontos Método que executa a lógica do jogo a cada passo (tempo), retornando pontos a serem exibidos na tela. Ele deve:  Calcular a posição de cada pássaro, verificando se ele colidiu com algum obstáculo, porco ou chão. Retornar instâncias da classe Ponto, informando x, y e caracter respectivo a cada ator.  Divirta-se!!!! Powered by Python Pro Observação Importante Esse projeto usa somente o interpretador padrão do Python. Para fazer jogos com mais interatividade, existe a biblioteca Pygame. Ela não foi utilizada por motivos de simplicidade, para evitar que o aluno iniciante tenha dificuldades na hora de instalar o projeto. Contudo o Estevão Fonseca fez um versão com essa biblioteca, confira o projeto: https://github.com/estevaofon/angry-birds-python Ele também colocou esse vídeo no Youtube. "

Dependencies At the moment this package only runs on Linux and requires libstapsdt to be installed to create runtime probes. Ubuntu 16.04 To install libstapsdt, run: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sthima/oss sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libstapsdt0 libstapsdt-dev Other Build from libstapsdt. Install pip install stapsdt Example The following code will create a probe named firstProbe. from time import sleep  import stapsdt  provider = stapsdt.Provider(""pythonapp"") probe = provider.add_probe(     ""firstProbe"", stapsdt.ArgTypes.uint64, stapsdt.ArgTypes.int32) provider.load()   while True:     print(""Firing probe..."")     if probe.fire(""My little probe"", 42):         print(""Probe fired!"")     sleep(1) You can then trace this probe with any tool able to trace Systemtap's probes. Here's an example with eBPF/bcc: sudo trace -p PID 'u::firstProbe ""%s - %d"", arg1, arg2' "

To further my skills with Python I will be creating a tic-tac-toe game where you will play against an AI. My purpose for writing this software is so that I can further my knowledge with the Python coding language. I will need to push myself in order to complete this assignment, and hopefully will have created something fun to use by the end of it.

About the project we are going to build In this tutorial we are going to be building a REST API that exposes 3 endpoints to the internet: GET /todos POST /todos DELETE /todos/<int:position>  GET /todos Will return the list of all todos like this: [     {         ""done"": true,         ""label"": ""Sample Todo 1""     },     {         ""done"": true,         ""label"": ""Sample Todo 2""     } ] POST /todos It's going to add a new todo to the list, it will receive the following request body: {     ""done"": true,     ""label"": ""Sample Todo 1"" } And return the updated list of todos DELETE /todos/int:position It's going to remove one todo based on a given position at the end of the url, and return the updated list of todos.

It uses FastAPI to create endpoints and is running using uvicorn.  FastAPI uvicorn  Prerequisites I guess it's better to write every python app in its own virtual environment. Most of these libraries requires Python 3.6+. $ sudo apt install python3.8-venv $ pip install --user virtualenv  # creates venv folder and its binary content $ python -m venv venv  # activate venv $ source venv/bin/activate  # or (in dev) install manually each library $ pip install -r requirements.txt  $ pip install fastapi uvicorn Required libraries  FastAPI (pip install fastapi) uvicorn   Start the server Start the server in reload mode. Each change in main.py file will be reloaded.  main - comes from main.py app - name of fastapi variable declared in main.py  $ uvicorn main:app --reload  # It should display  # Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) Code Update .gitignore with venv before commit. Add code to handle GET requests Code below creates several endpoints, all for GET method request:  / - handled by index() function /task/{taskId} - handled by getTask(taskId: int) that receives the path param from request.

The challenge is to make an application that can save properties registers. In the register model we need an name and for each property we need at least 3 and a maximum of 5 photos. This photos should be stored locally. About the Backend Architecture It uses an the DDD design pattern, being: domain, Infrastructure, services and presentation layers. Each layer has its own responsability and dependecies specified as follows:  Domain - Does not depend on anybody, the main business rule of the application; Infrastructure - Any communication, storage, database that its outside of the application; Services - The use case of the application; Presentation - Data transformation and API / FrontEnd layers.  About the Technology It uses python 3.9.1. For the presentation layer we are using:  FastAPI for the API / FrontEnd server-side HTML render with Jinja Templates. For the Infrastructure layer we are using: PostgreSQL for the Database SQLAlchemy as the ORM; Local Storage for saving the image files.  The infrastructure layer has factories in case the Database, Storage or ORM type changes.

417675007;NeoSpecter;https://github.com/ridge-runner/NeoSpecter;Python;2021-10-16T00:40:01Z;0;0;0;NeoSpecter A Python script that inputs Excel data into the NeoSerra CRM. Libraries Used  Openpyxl to drive Excel. Selenium webdriver to fill-in web forms. Pandas may be used if Openpyxl is unable to perform as required. tkinter for GUI. Script bundled into .exe for easy use on Windows OS.  User Experience  User opens NeoSpector.exe. GUI loads. Shows user a folder picker widget. User clicks on folder picker and selects folder containing excel files with client award data. User clicks SELECT FOLDER BUTTON. User clicks LOAD EXCEL FILES BUTTON on GUI. Progress bar appears. Excel files are loaded. Success or failure status is displayed in pop-up. If successful, User clicks RUN SPECTOR BUTTON to activate Selenium. A warning message shown telling the user to not use their mouse or keyboard while Spector is running. User clicks OK BUTTON. Pop-up closes. Progress bar is shown. Selenium activates. Web browser is opened and navigates to NEO SERRA CRM LOGIN. LOG IN credintials are entered. Selenium navigates to AWARDS PAGE. clicks new award. Copies data from the Excel sheets and enters it into the Neo Serra Webforms. Typing simulation is a nice add-on. Webform is saved. Selenium repeats steps 13-16 until all of the excel data has been entered. Spector shows dialogue box showing that the operation is successful. User is returned to home screen.  Process list With PANDAS  Client excel data and client awards data is collected into PANDAS. THIS IS ALL PUBLIC INFORMATION. PANDAS array is used as the data source for the webdriver.  Misc. Features   Config file A simple configuration file/module will be used to set the script parameters. These parameters will be set using the tkinter GUI or by manually changing the file.   Interactive instructions A manual to help orient new users in how to use the program.   Ghost Icon used as mascot   ERRORS NeoSpecter is rigid in that it relies on the Excel data formats and the NeoSerra webforms to remain the same over time. If the formating is changed with the excel datafile exports from EVA or NeoSerra changes the XPATH of their awards webform, the program will break.

This is a Python script that will send the current status of Parsec on the computer that it is installed on set to run every 5 seconds. Installation Run parse.py in C:\ProgramData\Parsec where the log.txt file resides. Modify the IP address as necessary. Make a shortcut to run on startup inside of shell:startup. In the panel settings, set Connect null values to always to cover up the missing points when you initially connect to the host. A sample dashboard sampleGrafanaDash.json has been included. Simply import it directly into Grafana. Limitations As it is run on the same machine as the Parsec host, it will only be able to send data when it is online. When the host is shutdown, there will be null fields that Grafana cannot make a graph with - creating an air gap between data:  My bandaid solution for the time being is to run a simple ping script, locally on the Graphite server, that is run every 5 seconds that will set each record to 0 if the Parsec host is offline. A more ideal solution would be to run the script entirely on the Graphite server mounting the C:\ProgramData\Parsec via SMB/CIFS to avoid the mess of running 2 different scripts doing the same thing.

It is a relatively imperfect module but beginners can quickly use it to make a decomposition-integration prediction by CEEMDAN, Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (Torres et al. 2011), and LSTM, Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). If you use or refer to the content of this project, please cite paper: ""Zhou, F. T. (2021). Carbon price forecasting based on CEEMDAN and LSTM. Unpublished now."" Flowchart  Install First, download CEEMDAN_LSTM.py to your computer, and create a new file that can run python. If you can use Jupyter, you can directly download CEEMDAN LSTM of CarbonPrice.ipynb at the same time and follow the steps inside to complete the prediction. import CEEMDAN_LSTM as cl If an error occurs, please check the modules that need to be installed. Note if the error is that pyemd does not exist, please install EMD-signal rather than pyemd module. pip install datetime pip install EMD-signal # pyemd pip install vmdpy pip install sampen pip install tensorflow==2.5.0 Preparation Help or Example You can use the code to call for a guideline or help. It is not recommended to use cl.run_exmaple() because the integration way by sample entropy is not the same every time. cl.guideline() cl.guideline_vars() cl.example() Declare the path Determine folders to store datasets and output results. The folder will be created automatically when the code is run for the first time. Please download cl_sample_dataset.csv and put it into the declared folder. If it runs successfully, the program will display a picture of the series. The default dataset saving path: D:\CEEMDAN_LSTM\ The default figures saving path: D:\CEEMDAN_LSTM\figures\ The default logs and output saving path: D:\CEEMDAN_LSTM\subset\ The default dataset name: cl_sample_dataset (must be csv file) series = cl.declare_path() If you want to use anthor folders, you can use cl.declare_path(path="""",figure_path="""",log_path="""",dataset_name="""") (must be csv file). If you want to use your own data, you can use cl.declare_path(series=pd.Series) (must be pd.Series). Start to predict 0. Statistical tests (not necessary) The code will ouput the reuslt of ADF test, Ljung-Box Test, Jarque-Bera Test, and plot ACF and PACF figures. cl.statistical_tests() 1. Declare mode and variables Importantly!, you need to declare decomposition mode and global variables.It is recommended to declare variables first every time you predict or decompose and other operations. Default value: mode='ceemdan', Mainly determine the decomposition method form='', Integration form only effective after integration data_back=30, The number of previous days related to today periods=100, The length of the days to forecast epochs=100, LSTM epochs patience=10, Patience of adaptive learning rate and early stop, suggesting epochs/10 cl.declare_vars() 2. Decomposition and Integration Choose a method to decompose the original data from mode='emd', mode='eemd', or mode='ceemdan' by cl.declare_vars(mode=''). imfs = cl.emd_decom() Calculate sample entropy cl.sample_entropy() Integrate subsequences, where form represents the integration way. form = [[0,1],[2,3,4],[5,6,7]] cl.integrate(inte_form=form)  3. Forecast Before forecasting, it is recommended to redeclare the variables. Variable form you can get from integration. There are many methods to choose, including single, ensemble, respective, hybrid, and mutiple. cl.declare_vars(mode='ceemdan',form='233',epochs=100) #  cl.Single_LSTM() You can try other methods cl.Single_LSTM(draw=False,show_model=False) cl.Ensemble_LSTM() cl.Hybrid_LSTM() cl.Multi_pred(run_times=10,ensemble_lstm=True,respective_lstm=True) 4. Re-decomposition After the first decomposition above, some sub-sequences are still difficult to predict, so they can be decomposed again. df_redecom = cl.re_decom(redecom_mode='vmd',redecom_list=[0])  df_input['sum'] = series.values cl.Ensemble_LSTM(df=df_redecom,show_model=False) For hybrid models, you can directly add parameters redecom='vmd'. cl.Hybrid_LSTM(redecom='vmd') An example of BeijingETS.csv Hybrid method df_bjETS = pd.read_csv(PATH+'data\\BeijingETS.csv',header=0,parse_dates=[""date""],                        date_parser=lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, ""%Y%m%d"")) series_bj = pd.Series(df_bjETS['close'].values,index = df_bjETS['date']).sort_index().astype(float) cl.declare_vars(mode='ceemdan') ceemdan_bj = cl.emd_decom(series=series_bj) cl.sample_entropy(imfs_df=ceemdan_bj) inte_bj = cl.integrate(df=ceemdan_bj,inte_form=[[0,1],[2,3],[4,5],[6,7,8]]) # form may not be the same every time cl.declare_vars(mode='ceemdan_se',form='233',epochs=10) cl.Hybrid_LSTM(df=inte_bj,redecom='vmd') Time-saving method df_bjETS = pd.read_csv(PATH+'data\\BeijingETS.csv',header=0,parse_dates=[""date""],                        date_parser=lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, ""%Y%m%d"")) series_bj = pd.Series(df_bjETS['close'].values,index = df_bjETS['date']).sort_index().astype(float) cl.declare_vars(mode='ceemdan',epochs=1000) ceemdan_bj = cl.emd_decom(series=series_bj) df_vmd_bj = cl.re_decom(df=ceemdan_bj,redecom_mode='vmd',redecom_list=0)  cl.Ensemble_LSTM(df=df_vmd_bj) Predict the next day Set next_pred for cl.Hybrid_LSTM(next_pred=True). cl.Hybrid_LSTM(next_pred=True) or you can try time saving method by cl.run_predict() cl.run_predict(series=series,epochs=1000) Postscript If you have any questions, please leave your comment or email me.

417699954;Tech-Eye;https://github.com/munal0803/Tech-Eye;Python;2021-10-16T03:05:41Z;0;0;0;"GuidEye A python software that can help blind people find things like laptops, phones, etc the same way a guide dog guides a blind person in finding his way. The problem GuidEye solves Consider a scenario. A blind person is alone at home and needs something like he wants to find his movable chair but has forgotten where it was placed. Normally he would have to guess the direction and try by reaching out to the distances if there is no one to help. In this case he would have to waste a lot of energy and time and there is also a risk of them hurting or wounding themselves in the process. Our project solves this problem. A person using this would simply open this project, it would ask him what he wants and he would simply say ""chair"", the project would detect and start searching for the chair with the help of machine learning item detection using the camera of the device. The person then would have to simply rotate and would try to find the chair using his phone. As soon as the software detects a chair, it calls out just like a metal detector beeps. Following this sound, the person can find the object he wants (in this case a chair) and reach to it with ease. Thus, this software acts like a guide dog helping out a blind person Challenges we ran into Challenges we ran into while coming up and implementing this project :  We wanted to solve a problem for blind people but were confused how could we do it. After coming up with this idea voice recognition and speaker acted as a small problem but was resolved. Training a model for detecting posed a problem. After this, coming up with a way of transferring and connecting a phone to the software  Technologies used 1.TensorFlow 2.OpenCV 3.PythonSpeech 4.RecognitionText-to-Speech 5.SSD "

Option 1 allows the user to keep guessing by themselves. Option 2 allows the user to watch the CPU make guesses. Option 3 allows the User and CPU to race to guess the correct number first. The code runs well for the most part, but there is some breakdown with the algorithm in option 3 that'll I'll fix at a future date. I'd like to speed up the CPU guessing, by making it account for the User's most recent guess, and I'd like to stop the algorithms breakdown when closing in on the correct value. I'll also need to install some form of exception hjandling in the future.

It uses Abstract Syntax Tree and Regular Expressions Inspections  S001 - Line too long (contains more than 79 characters) S002 - Indentation is not a multiple of four S003 - Unnecessary semicolon after a statement S004 - Less than two spaces before inline comments S005 - TODO found (in comments only and case-insensitive) S006 - More than two blank lines preceding a code line S007 - Too many spaces after class/def S008 - Class name should be written in CamelCase S009 - Function name should be written in snake_case S010 - Argument name should be written in snake_case S011 - Variable should be written in snake_case (only applies to the ones defined in functions bodies) S012 - Default argument value is mutable  Usage You should specify the path to a file or directory in the command line. In case a directory is specified, the program will analyse all python files in the directory and subdirectories. python code_analyzer.py directory-or-file  Examples > python code_analyzer.py /path/to/file/script.py /path/to/file/script.py: Line 1: S004 At least two spaces required before inline comments /path/to/file/script.py: Line 2: S003 Unnecessary semicolon /path/to/file/script.py: Line 3: S001 Too long line /path/to/file/script.py: Line 3: S003 Unnecessary semicolon /path/to/file/script.py: Line 6: S001 Too long line /path/to/file/script.py: Line 11: S006 More than two blank lines used before this line /path/to/file/script.py: Line 13: S003 Unnecessary semicolon /path/to/file/script.py: Line 13: S004 At least two spaces required before inline comments /path/to/file/script.py: Line 13: S005 TODO found  > python code_analyzer.py /path/to/project /path/to/project/__init__.py: Line 1: S001 Too long line /path/to/project/script1.py: Line 1: S004 At least two spaces required before inline comments /path/to/project/script1.py: Line 2: S003 Unnecessary semicolon /path/to/project/script2.py: Line 1: S004 At least two spaces required before inline comments /path/to/project/script2.py: Line 3: S001 Too long line /path/to/project/somedir/script.py: Line 3: S001 Too long line /path/to/project/test.py: Line 3: Line 13: S003 Unnecessary semicolon

Sets are another standard Python data type that also store values. In this tutorial we will learn about Python sets: what they are, how to create them, when to use them, built-in functions, and their relationship to set theory operations. Key takeaways: This tutorial will introduce you a few topics about Python sets and set theory: How to initialize empty sets and sets with values. How to add and remove values from sets How to use efficiently use sets for tasks such as membership tests and removing duplicate values from a list. How to perform common set operations like unions, intersections, difference, and symmetric difference. The difference between a set and a frozenset References: N/A

In order to a profile a specific function, you add a decorator, @profile, to the desired function. Run kernprof -l YOURCODE.PY, this will create a *.lprof file for you which can be viewed by running python3 -m line_profiler YOURCODE.PY.lprof  Resources  https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/SystemDevelopment/profiling.html

We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: September 1, 2021 Gitpod Reminders To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type: python3 -m http.server A blue button should appear to click: Make Public, Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser. To run a backend Python file, type python3 app.py, if your Python file is named app.py of course. A blue button should appear to click: Make Public, Another blue button should appear to click: Open Browser. In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the sudo (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons. To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:  Log in to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings in the menu under your avatar. Scroll down to the API Key and click Reveal Copy the key In Gitpod, from the terminal, run heroku_config Paste in your API key when asked  You can now use the heroku CLI program - try running heroku apps to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with Regenerate API Key.  Release History We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history: September 1 2021: Remove PGHOSTADDR environment variable. July 19 2021: Remove font_fix script now that the terminal font issue is fixed. July 2 2021: Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX. June 30 2021: Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file. June 10 2021: Added: font_fix script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue May 10 2021: Added heroku_config script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable. April 7 2021: Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia. October 21 2020: Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now. October 08 2020: Additional large Gitpod files (core.mongo* and core.python*) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the .gitignore by default. September 22 2020: Gitpod occasionally creates large core.Microsoft files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A .gitignore file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files. April 16 2020: The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer. April 13 2020: Added the Prettier code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod. February 2020: The initialisation files now do not auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing. December 2019: Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type !bscdn in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the README.md file at the official repo for more options.  FAQ about the uptime script Why have you added this script? It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy. How will this affect me? For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:  An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started. The current date and time The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.  It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work. So….? We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it. Can I opt out? Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script: pkill uptime.sh rm .vscode/uptime.sh  Anything more? Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the uptime.sh file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.  Happy coding! "

Training Put your training data in the 'data/' directory (or anywhere you like), and you can train a trigram model through: python train.py -n 3 -f 'data/train_set.txt' Token counts will be generated in the form of json files in the 'n_gram_bank/' directory. Testing Put your testing data in the 'data/' directory (or anywhere you like), and you use the trained trigram model to test through: python test.py -n 3 -f 'data/test_set.txt' Discounting method Different discounting methods are provided. Now includes:  Good Turing Discounting: 'turing' Gumbel Discounting: 'gumbel' (Default)  Take Truing Discounting as an example: python train.py -n 3 -f 'data/train_set.txt' -m 'turing' Instant testing After the model is trained, you can instantly test your sentence through the '-inst' arg. Note that any punctuation or capital letter should not be included. python test.py -n 2 -inst 'every day he gets up at six goes jogging and eats breakfast at seven' which outputs: PPL = 17.69532  Interesting facts Through the instant feedback command, you can see how a right-ordered scentence gets a lower probability when it's scrambled: python test.py -n 2 -inst 'mother always say an apple a day keeps the doctor away' gets the result: PPL = 14.83194  python test.py -n 2 -inst 'apple always say a doctor a day keeps the mother away' gets the result: PPL = 25.77687  python test.py -n 2 -inst 'always away mother an apple day doctor a keeps the say' gets the result: PPL = 35.93410  As the sentence gets more chaos, PPL increases.

Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. The housingprices.csv contains a training set of housing prices in Port land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), and second column is the price of the house.

While we can do the same by either storing the characters of the string in a data structure or explicitly writing down statements to verify, string validators in Python can simplify our task. This can be useful when validating a password string or any other user input. String validators are essentially functions that allow us to check if a string meets certain criteria. This post is an introduction to string validators and assumes no prior knowledge of them  Checking if a Given String Is Alphanumeric Checking if a Given String Is Alphabetic Checking if a Given String Is All Numbers Checking if a Given String Is Lowercase Checking if a Given String Is Uppercase Checking if a Given String Is Blank Checking if a Given String Is Title Cased

Here's an example.  Python Script  In the following snippet you see a short Python code that is using the Python Requests Package to perfom an HTTP Post Request with encapsulated JSON Data.  import requests  if __name__ == ""__main__"":      # individual datacake webhook url     datacake_url = ""https://api.datacake.co/integrations/api/ae6dd531-4cf6-4966-b5c9-6c43939aae90/""      # Just some random demo data     number_of_persons_a = 234     number_of_persons_b = 345     additional_payload = ""bla bla""     some_data = 23.456      # create api call     r = requests.post(datacake_url, json={         ""number_of_persons_a"": number_of_persons_a,         ""number_of_persons_b"": number_of_persons_b,         ""additional_payload"": additional_payload,         ""some_data"": some_data     })      print(r) Datacake Decoder  We are sending Data to Datacake using an individual webhook url. On the device we need to provide a short decoder that decodes the incoming data using a short javascript snippet. Paste the following snippet into the Datacake Decoder Section for HTTP Payload Decoder.  function Decoder(request) {      // hardcoded serial     var serial = ""9c26490c-8cb0-4ab0-a27f-989ffc1f4339"";      // extract payload from request.body and parse as json     var payload = JSON.parse(request.body)      // extract data     var number_of_persons_a = payload.number_of_persons_a;     var number_of_persons_b = payload.number_of_persons_b;     var additional_payload = payload.additional_payload;     var some_data = payload.some_data;      // forward to datacake     return [         {             device: serial, // payload decoder runs on product so we need to tell which device we want to route the data to             field: ""NUMBER_OF_PERSONS_A"", // the field identifier from database             value: number_of_persons_a // the actual data extracted from request.body         },         {             device: serial,             field: ""NUMBER_OF_PERSONS_B"",             value: number_of_persons_b         },         {             device: serial,             field: ""ADDITIONAL_PAYLOAD"",             value: additional_payload         },         {             device: serial,             field: ""SOME_DATA"",             value: some_data         },     ]; } "

of which have been written down.  >>> import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! Return to the Top Python Basics Math Operators From Highest to Lowest precedence:    Operators Operation Example     ** Exponent 2 ** 3 = 8   % Modulus/Remainder 22 % 8 = 6   // Integer division 22 // 8 = 2   / Division 22 / 8 = 2.75   * Multiplication 3 * 3 = 9   - Subtraction 5 - 2 = 3   + Addition 2 + 2 = 4    Examples of expressions in the interactive shell: >>> 2 + 3 * 6 20 >>> (2 + 3) * 6 30 >>> 2 ** 8 256 >>> 23 // 7 3 >>> 23 % 7 2 >>> (5 - 1) * ((7 + 1) / (3 - 1)) 16.0 Return to the Top Data Types    Data Type Examples     Integers -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   Floating-point numbers -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25   Strings 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'    Return to the Top String Concatenation and Replication String concatenation: >>> 'Alice' 'Bob' 'AliceBob' Note: Avoid + operator for string concatenation. Prefer string formatting. String Replication: >>> 'Alice' * 5 'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice' Return to the Top Variables You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following rules:  It can be only one word. It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character. It can’t begin with a number. Variable name starting with an underscore (_) are considered as ""unuseful`.  Example: >>> spam = 'Hello' >>> spam 'Hello' >>> _spam = 'Hello' _spam should not be used again in the code. Return to the Top Comments Inline comment: # This is a comment Multiline comment: # This is a # multiline comment Code with a comment: a = 1  # initialization Please note the two spaces in front of the comment. Function docstring: def foo():     """"""     This is a function docstring     You can also use:     ''' Function Docstring '''     """""" Return to the Top The print() Function >>> print('Hello world!') Hello world! >>> a = 1 >>> print('Hello world!', a) Hello world! 1 Return to the Top The input() Function Example Code: >>> print('What is your name?')   # ask for their name >>> myName = input() >>> print('It is good to meet you, {}'.format(myName)) What is your name? Al It is good to meet you, Al Return to the Top The len() Function Evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string: >>> len('hello') 5 Note: test of emptiness of strings, lists, dictionary, etc, should not use len, but prefer direct boolean evaluation. >>> a = [1, 2, 3] >>> if a: >>>     print(""the list is not empty!"") Return to the Top The str(), int(), and float() Functions Integer to String or Float: >>> str(29) '29' >>> print('I am {} years old.'.format(str(29))) I am 29 years old. >>> str(-3.14) '-3.14' Float to Integer: >>> int(7.7) 7 >>> int(7.7) + 1 8 Return to the Top Flow Control Comparison Operators    Operator Meaning     == Equal to   != Not equal to   < Less than   > Greater Than   <= Less than or Equal to   >= Greater than or Equal to    These operators evaluate to True or False depending on the values you give them. Examples: >>> 42 == 42 True >>> 40 == 42 False >>> 'hello' == 'hello' True >>> 'hello' == 'Hello' False >>> 'dog' != 'cat' True >>> 42 == 42.0 True >>> 42 == '42' False Boolean evaluation Never use == or != operator to evaluate boolean operation. Use the is or is not operators, or use implicit boolean evaluation. NO (even if they are valid Python): >>> True == True True >>> True != False True YES (even if they are valid Python): >>> True is True True >>> True is not False True These statements are equivalent: >>> if a is True: >>>    pass >>> if a is not False: >>>    pass >>> if a: >>>    pass And these as well: >>> if a is False: >>>    pass >>> if a is not True: >>>    pass >>> if not a: >>>    pass Return to the Top Boolean Operators There are three Boolean operators: and, or, and not. The and Operator’s Truth Table:    Expression Evaluates to     True and True True   True and False False   False and True False   False and False False    The or Operator’s Truth Table:    Expression Evaluates to     True or True True   True or False True   False or True True   False or False False    The not Operator’s Truth Table:    Expression Evaluates to     not True False   not False True    Return to the Top Mixing Boolean and Comparison Operators >>> (4 < 5) and (5 < 6) True >>> (4 < 5) and (9 < 6) False >>> (1 == 2) or (2 == 2) True You can also use multiple Boolean operators in an expression, along with the comparison operators: >>> 2 + 2 == 4 and not 2 + 2 == 5 and 2 * 2 == 2 + 2 True Return to the Top if Statements if name == 'Alice':     print('Hi, Alice.') Return to the Top else Statements name = 'Bob' if name == 'Alice':     print('Hi, Alice.') else:     print('Hello, stranger.') Return to the Top elif Statements name = 'Bob' age = 5 if name == 'Alice':     print('Hi, Alice.') elif age < 12:     print('You are not Alice, kiddo.') name = 'Bob' age = 30 if name == 'Alice':     print('Hi, Alice.') elif age < 12:     print('You are not Alice, kiddo.') else:     print('You are neither Alice nor a little kid.') Return to the Top while Loop Statements spam = 0 while spam < 5:     print('Hello, world.')     spam = spam + 1 Return to the Top break Statements If the execution reaches a break statement, it immediately exits the while loop’s clause: while True:     print('Please type your name.')     name = input()     if name == 'your name':         break print('Thank you!') Return to the Top continue Statements When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop. while True:     print('Who are you?')     name = input()     if name != 'Joe':         continue     print('Hello, Joe. What is the password? (It is a fish.)')     password = input()     if password == 'swordfish':         break print('Access granted.') Return to the Top for Loops and the range() Function >>> print('My name is') >>> for i in range(5): >>>     print('Jimmy Five Times ({})'.format(str(i))) My name is Jimmy Five Times (0) Jimmy Five Times (1) Jimmy Five Times (2) Jimmy Five Times (3) Jimmy Five Times (4) The range() function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be the start and stop values, and the third will be the step argument. The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration. >>> for i in range(0, 10, 2): >>>    print(i) 0 2 4 6 8 You can even use a negative number for the step argument to make the for loop count down instead of up. >>> for i in range(5, -1, -1): >>>     print(i) 5 4 3 2 1 0 For else statement This allows to specify a statement to execute in case of the full loop has been executed. Only useful when a break condition can occur in the loop: >>> for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: >>>    if i == 3: >>>        break >>> else: >>>    print(""only executed when no item of the list is equal to 3"") Return to the Top Importing Modules import random for i in range(5):     print(random.randint(1, 10)) import random, sys, os, math from random import * Return to the Top Ending a Program Early with sys.exit() import sys  while True:     print('Type exit to exit.')     response = input()     if response == 'exit':         sys.exit()     print('You typed {}.'.format(response)) Return to the Top Functions >>> def hello(name): >>>     print('Hello {}'.format(name)) >>> >>> hello('Alice') >>> hello('Bob') Hello Alice Hello Bob Return to the Top Return Values and return Statements When creating a function using the def statement, you can specify what the return value should be with a return statement. A return statement consists of the following:   The return keyword.   The value or expression that the function should return.   import random def getAnswer(answerNumber):     if answerNumber == 1:         return 'It is certain'     elif answerNumber == 2:         return 'It is decidedly so'     elif answerNumber == 3:         return 'Yes'     elif answerNumber == 4:         return 'Reply hazy try again'     elif answerNumber == 5:         return 'Ask again later'     elif answerNumber == 6:         return 'Concentrate and ask again'     elif answerNumber == 7:         return 'My reply is no'     elif answerNumber == 8:         return 'Outlook not so good'     elif answerNumber == 9:         return 'Very doubtful'  r = random.randint(1, 9) fortune = getAnswer(r) print(fortune) Return to the Top The None Value >>> spam = print('Hello!') Hello! >>> spam is None True Note: never compare to None with the == operator. Always use is. Return to the Top Keyword Arguments and print() >>> print('Hello', end='') >>> print('World') HelloWorld >>> print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice') cats dogs mice >>> print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep=',') cats,dogs,mice Return to the Top Local and Global Scope   Code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.   However, a local scope can access global variables.   Code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other local scope.   You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named spam and a global variable also named spam.   Return to the Top The global Statement If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, use the global statement: >>> def spam(): >>>     global eggs >>>     eggs = 'spam' >>> >>> eggs = 'global' >>> spam() >>> print(eggs) spam There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:   If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all functions), then it is always a global variable.   If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global variable.   Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, it is a local variable.   But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.

So instead of doing this: >>> cat = ['fat', 'orange', 'loud']  >>> size = cat[0]  >>> color = cat[1]  >>> disposition = cat[2] You could type this line of code: >>> cat = ['fat', 'orange', 'loud']  >>> size, color, disposition = cat The multiple assignment trick can also be used to swap the values in two variables: >>> a, b = 'Alice', 'Bob' >>> a, b = b, a >>> print(a) 'Bob' >>> print(b) 'Alice' Return to the Top Augmented Assignment Operators    Operator Equivalent     spam += 1 spam = spam + 1   spam -= 1 spam = spam - 1   spam *= 1 spam = spam * 1   spam /= 1 spam = spam / 1   spam %= 1 spam = spam % 1    Examples: >>> spam = 'Hello' >>> spam += ' world!' >>> spam 'Hello world!'  >>> bacon = ['Zophie'] >>> bacon *= 3 >>> bacon ['Zophie', 'Zophie', 'Zophie'] Return to the Top Finding a Value in a List with the index() Method >>> spam = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Fat-tail', 'Pooka']  >>> spam.index('Pooka') 1 Return to the Top Adding Values to Lists with the append() and insert() Methods append(): >>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']  >>> spam.append('moose')  >>> spam ['cat', 'dog', 'bat', 'moose'] insert(): >>> spam = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat']  >>> spam.insert(1, 'chicken')  >>> spam ['cat', 'chicken', 'dog', 'bat'] Return to the Top Removing Values from Lists with remove() >>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']  >>> spam.remove('bat')  >>> spam ['cat', 'rat', 'elephant'] If the value appears multiple times in the list, only the first instance of the value will be removed.

Return to the Top The setdefault() Method Let's consider this code: spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5}  if 'color' not in spam:     spam['color'] = 'black' Using setdefault we could write the same code more succinctly: >>> spam = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5} >>> spam.setdefault('color', 'black') 'black' >>> spam {'color': 'black', 'age': 5, 'name': 'Pooka'} >>> spam.setdefault('color', 'white') 'black' >>> spam {'color': 'black', 'age': 5, 'name': 'Pooka'} Return to the Top Pretty Printing >>> import pprint >>> >>> message = 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking >>> thirteen.' >>> count = {} >>> >>> for character in message: >>>     count.setdefault(character, 0) >>>     count[character] = count[character] + 1 >>> >>> pprint.pprint(count) {' ': 13,  ',': 1,  '.': 1,  'A': 1,  'I': 1,  'a': 4,  'b': 1,  'c': 3,  'd': 3,  'e': 5,  'g': 2,  'h': 3,  'i': 6,  'k': 2,  'l': 3,  'n': 4,  'o': 2,  'p': 1,  'r': 5,  's': 3,  't': 6,  'w': 2,  'y': 1} Return to the Top Merge two dictionaries # in Python 3.5+: >>> x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} >>> y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4} >>> z = {**x, **y} >>> z {'c': 4, 'a': 1, 'b': 3}  # in Python 2.7 >>> z = dict(x, **y) >>> z {'c': 4, 'a': 1, 'b': 3} sets From the Python 3 documentation  A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.  Initializing a set There are two ways to create sets: using curly braces {} and the built-in function set() >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s = set([1, 2, 3]) When creating an empty set, be sure to not use the curly braces {} or you will get an empty dictionary instead. >>> s = {} >>> type(s) <class 'dict'> sets: unordered collections of unique elements A set automatically remove all the duplicate values. >>> s = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4} >>> s {1, 2, 3, 4} And as an unordered data type, they can't be indexed. >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s[0] Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing >>> set add() and update() Using the add() method we can add a single element to the set. >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s.add(4) >>> s {1, 2, 3, 4} And with update(), multiple ones . >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s.update([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) >>> s {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  # remember, sets automatically remove duplicates set remove() and discard() Both methods will remove an element from the set, but remove() will raise a key error if the value doesn't exist. >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s.remove(3) >>> s {1, 2} >>> s.remove(3) Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> KeyError: 3 discard() won't raise any errors. >>> s = {1, 2, 3} >>> s.discard(3) >>> s {1, 2} >>> s.discard(3) >>> set union() union() or | will create a new set that contains all the elements from the sets provided. >>> s1 = {1, 2, 3} >>> s2 = {3, 4, 5} >>> s1.union(s2)  # or 's1 | s2' {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} set intersection intersection or & will return a set containing only the elements that are common to all of them. >>> s1 = {1, 2, 3} >>> s2 = {2, 3, 4} >>> s3 = {3, 4, 5} >>> s1.intersection(s2, s3)  # or 's1 & s2 & s3' {3} set difference difference or - will return only the elements that are unique to the first set (invoked set). >>> s1 = {1, 2, 3} >>> s2 = {2, 3, 4} >>> s1.difference(s2)  # or 's1 - s2' {1} >>> s2.difference(s1) # or 's2 - s1' {4} set symetric_difference symetric_difference or ^ will return all the elements that are not common between them. >>> s1 = {1, 2, 3} >>> s2 = {2, 3, 4} >>> s1.symmetric_difference(s2)  # or 's1 ^ s2' {1, 4} Return to the Top itertools Module The itertools module is a collection of tools intended to be fast and use memory efficiently when handling iterators (like lists or dictionaries). From the official Python 3.x documentation:  The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.  The itertools module comes in the standard library and must be imported. The operator module will also be used. This module is not necessary when using itertools, but needed for some of the examples below. Return to the Top accumulate() Makes an iterator that returns the results of a function. itertools.accumulate(iterable[, func]) Example: >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] >>> result = itertools.accumulate(data, operator.mul) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 1 2 6 24 120 The operator.mul takes two numbers and multiplies them: operator.mul(1, 2) 2 operator.mul(2, 3) 6 operator.mul(6, 4) 24 operator.mul(24, 5) 120 Passing a function is optional: >>> data = [5, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1] >>> result = itertools.accumulate(data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 5 7 13 17 22 31 32 If no function is designated the items will be summed: 5 5 + 2 = 7 7 + 6 = 13 13 + 4 = 17 17 + 5 = 22 22 + 9 = 31 31 + 1 = 32 Return to the Top combinations() Takes an iterable and a integer. This will create all the unique combination that have r members. itertools.combinations(iterable, r) Example: >>> shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square',] >>> result = itertools.combinations(shapes, 2) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) ('circle', 'triangle') ('circle', 'square') ('triangle', 'square') Return to the Top combinations_with_replacement() Just like combinations(), but allows individual elements to be repeated more than once. itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iterable, r) Example: >>> shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square'] >>> result = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(shapes, 2) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) ('circle', 'circle') ('circle', 'triangle') ('circle', 'square') ('triangle', 'triangle') ('triangle', 'square') ('square', 'square') Return to the Top count() Makes an iterator that returns evenly spaced values starting with number start. itertools.count(start=0, step=1) Example: >>> for i in itertools.count(10,3): >>>    print(i) >>>    if i > 20: >>>        break 10 13 16 19 22 Return to the Top cycle() This function cycles through an iterator endlessly. itertools.cycle(iterable) Example: >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'violet'] >>> for color in itertools.cycle(colors): >>>    print(color) red orange yellow green blue violet red orange When reached the end of the iterable it start over again from the beginning. Return to the Top chain() Take a series of iterables and return them as one long iterable. itertools.chain(*iterables) Example: >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'] >>> shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'pentagon'] >>> result = itertools.chain(colors, shapes) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) red orange yellow green blue circle triangle square pentagon Return to the Top compress() Filters one iterable with another. itertools.compress(data, selectors) Example: >>> shapes = ['circle', 'triangle', 'square', 'pentagon'] >>> selections = [True, False, True, False] >>> result = itertools.compress(shapes, selections) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) circle square Return to the Top dropwhile() Make an iterator that drops elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true; afterwards, returns every element. itertools.dropwhile(predicate, iterable) Example: >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] >>> result = itertools.dropwhile(lambda x: x<5, data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 Return to the Top filterfalse() Makes an iterator that filters elements from iterable returning only those for which the predicate is False. itertools.filterfalse(predicate, iterable) Example: >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] >>> result = itertools.filterfalse(lambda x: x<5, data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 5 6 7 8 9 10 Return to the Top groupby() Simply put, this function groups things together. itertools.groupby(iterable, key=None) Example: >>> robots = [{     'name': 'blaster',     'faction': 'autobot' }, {     'name': 'galvatron',     'faction': 'decepticon' }, {     'name': 'jazz',     'faction': 'autobot' }, {     'name': 'metroplex',     'faction': 'autobot' }, {     'name': 'megatron',     'faction': 'decepticon' }, {     'name': 'starcream',     'faction': 'decepticon' }] >>> for key, group in itertools.groupby(robots, key=lambda x: x['faction']): >>>    print(key) >>>    print(list(group)) autobot [{'name': 'blaster', 'faction': 'autobot'}] decepticon [{'name': 'galvatron', 'faction': 'decepticon'}] autobot [{'name': 'jazz', 'faction': 'autobot'}, {'name': 'metroplex', 'faction': 'autobot'}] decepticon [{'name': 'megatron', 'faction': 'decepticon'}, {'name': 'starcream', 'faction': 'decepticon'}] Return to the Top islice() This function is very much like slices. This allows you to cut out a piece of an iterable. itertools.islice(iterable, start, stop[, step]) Example: >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue',] >>> few_colors = itertools.islice(colors, 2) >>> for each in few_colors: >>>    print(each) red orange Return to the Top permutations() itertools.permutations(iterable, r=None) Example: >>> alpha_data = ['a', 'b', 'c'] >>> result = itertools.permutations(alpha_data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) ('a', 'b', 'c') ('a', 'c', 'b') ('b', 'a', 'c') ('b', 'c', 'a') ('c', 'a', 'b') ('c', 'b', 'a') Return to the Top product() Creates the cartesian products from a series of iterables. >>> num_data = [1, 2, 3] >>> alpha_data = ['a', 'b', 'c'] >>> result = itertools.product(num_data, alpha_data) >>> for each in result:     print(each) (1, 'a') (1, 'b') (1, 'c') (2, 'a') (2, 'b') (2, 'c') (3, 'a') (3, 'b') (3, 'c') Return to the Top repeat() This function will repeat an object over and over again. Unless, there is a times argument. itertools.repeat(object[, times]) Example: >>> for i in itertools.repeat(""spam"", 3):     print(i) spam spam spam Return to the Top starmap() Makes an iterator that computes the function using arguments obtained from the iterable. itertools.starmap(function, iterable) Example: >>> data = [(2, 6), (8, 4), (7, 3)] >>> result = itertools.starmap(operator.mul, data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 12 32 21 Return to the Top takewhile() The opposite of dropwhile(). Makes an iterator and returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true. itertools.takewhile(predicate, iterable) Example: >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] >>> result = itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x<5, data) >>> for each in result: >>>    print(each) 1 2 3 4 Return to the Top tee() Return n independent iterators from a single iterable. itertools.tee(iterable, n=2) Example: >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'] >>> alpha_colors, beta_colors = itertools.tee(colors) >>> for each in alpha_colors: >>>    print(each) red orange yellow green blue >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'] >>> alpha_colors, beta_colors = itertools.tee(colors) >>> for each in beta_colors: >>>    print(each) red orange yellow green blue Return to the Top zip_longest() Makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted. itertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None) Example: >>> colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue',] >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,] >>> for each in itertools.zip_longest(colors, data, fillvalue=None): >>>    print(each) ('red', 1) ('orange', 2) ('yellow', 3) ('green', 4) ('blue', 5) (None, 6) (None, 7) (None, 8) (None, 9) (None, 10) Return to the Top Comprehensions List comprehension >>> a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]  >>> [i - 1 for i in a] [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10] Set comprehension >>> b = {""abc"", ""def""} >>> {s.upper() for s in b} {""ABC"", ""DEF""} Dict comprehension >>> c = {'name': 'Pooka', 'age': 5} >>> {v: k for k, v in c.items()} {'Pooka': 'name', 5: 'age'} A List comprehension can be generated from a dictionary: >>> c = {'name': 'Pooka', 'first_name': 'Oooka'} >>> [""{}:{}"".format(k.upper(), v.upper()) for k, v in c.items()] ['NAME:POOKA', 'FIRST_NAME:OOOKA'] Manipulating Strings Escape Characters    Escape character Prints as     \' Single quote   \"" Double quote   \t Tab   \n Newline (line break)   \\ Backslash   \b Backspace   \ooo Octal value   \r Carriage Return    Example: >>> print(""Hello there!\nHow are you?\nI\'m doing fine."") Hello there! How are you? I'm doing fine. Return to the Top Raw Strings A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and prints any backslash that appears in the string. >>> print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.') That is Carol\'s cat.

Return to the Top String Formatting % operator >>> name = 'Pete' >>> 'Hello %s' % name ""Hello Pete"" We can use the %x format specifier to convert an int value to a string: >>> num = 5 >>> 'I have %x apples' % num ""I have 5 apples"" Note: For new code, using str.format or f-strings (Python 3.6+) is strongly recommended over the % operator. Return to the Top String Formatting (str.format) Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular. >>> name = 'John' >>> age = 20'  >>> ""Hello I'm {}, my age is {}"".format(name, age) ""Hello I'm John, my age is 20"" >>> ""Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}"".format(name, age) ""Hello I'm John, my age is 20"" The official Python 3.x documentation recommend str.format over the % operator:  The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.  Return to the Top Lazy string formatting You would only use %s string formatting on functions that can do lazy parameters evaluation, the most common being logging: Prefer: >>> name = ""alice"" >>> logging.debug(""User name: %s"", name) Over: >>> logging.debug(""User name: {}"".format(name)) Or: >>> logging.debug(""User name: "" + name) Return to the Top Formatted String Literals or f-strings (Python 3.6+) >>> name = 'Elizabeth' >>> f'Hello {name}!' 'Hello Elizabeth! It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it: >>> a = 5 >>> b = 10 >>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.' 'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.' Return to the Top Template Strings A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling format strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity template strings are a safer choice. >>> from string import Template >>> name = 'Elizabeth' >>> t = Template('Hey $name!') >>> t.substitute(name=name) 'Hey Elizabeth!' Return to the Top Regular Expressions  Import the regex module with import re. Create a Regex object with the re.compile() function. (Remember to use a raw string.) Pass the string you want to search into the Regex object’s search() method. This returns a Match object. Call the Match object’s group() method to return a string of the actual matched text.  All the regex functions in Python are in the re module: >>> import re Return to the Top Matching Regex Objects >>> phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d')  >>> mo = phone_num_regex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')  >>> print('Phone number found: {}'.format(mo.group())) Phone number found: 415-555-4242 Return to the Top Grouping with Parentheses >>> phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')  >>> mo = phone_num_regex.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')  >>> mo.group(1) '415'  >>> mo.group(2) '555-4242'  >>> mo.group(0) '415-555-4242'  >>> mo.group() '415-555-4242' To retrieve all the groups at once: use the groups() method—note the plural form for the name. >>> mo.groups() ('415', '555-4242')  >>> area_code, main_number = mo.groups()  >>> print(area_code) 415  >>> print(main_number) 555-4242 Return to the Top Matching Multiple Groups with the Pipe The | character is called a pipe. You can use it anywhere you want to match one of many expressions. For example, the regular expression r'Batman|Tina Fey' will match either 'Batman' or 'Tina Fey'. >>> hero_regex = re.compile (r'Batman|Tina Fey')  >>> mo1 = hero_regex.search('Batman and Tina Fey.')  >>> mo1.group() 'Batman'  >>> mo2 = hero_regex.search('Tina Fey and Batman.')  >>> mo2.group() 'Tina Fey' You can also use the pipe to match one of several patterns as part of your regex: >>> bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(man|mobile|copter|bat)')  >>> mo = bat_regex.search('Batmobile lost a wheel')  >>> mo.group() 'Batmobile'  >>> mo.group(1) 'mobile' Return to the Top Optional Matching with the Question Mark The ? character flags the group that precedes it as an optional part of the pattern. >>> bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)?man') >>> mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman') >>> mo1.group() 'Batman'  >>> mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman') >>> mo2.group() 'Batwoman' Return to the Top Matching Zero or More with the Star The * (called the star or asterisk) means “match zero or more”—the group that precedes the star can occur any number of times in the text. >>> bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)*man') >>> mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman') >>> mo1.group() 'Batman'  >>> mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman') >>> mo2.group() 'Batwoman'  >>> mo3 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwowowowoman') >>> mo3.group() 'Batwowowowoman' Return to the Top Matching One or More with the Plus While * means “match zero or more,” the + (or plus) means “match one or more”. The group preceding a plus must appear at least once. It is not optional: >>> bat_regex = re.compile(r'Bat(wo)+man') >>> mo1 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwoman') >>> mo1.group() 'Batwoman' >>> mo2 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batwowowowoman') >>> mo2.group() 'Batwowowowoman' >>> mo3 = bat_regex.search('The Adventures of Batman') >>> mo3 is None True Return to the Top Matching Specific Repetitions with Curly Brackets If you have a group that you want to repeat a specific number of times, follow the group in your regex with a number in curly brackets. For example, the regex (Ha){3} will match the string 'HaHaHa', but it will not match 'HaHa', since the latter has only two repeats of the (Ha) group. Instead of one number, you can specify a range by writing a minimum, a comma, and a maximum in between the curly brackets. For example, the regex (Ha){3,5} will match 'HaHaHa', 'HaHaHaHa', and 'HaHaHaHaHa'. >>> ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3}') >>> mo1 = ha_regex.search('HaHaHa') >>> mo1.group() 'HaHaHa' >>> mo2 = ha_regex.search('Ha') >>> mo2 is None True Return to the Top Greedy and Nongreedy Matching Python’s regular expressions are greedy by default, which means that in ambiguous situations they will match the longest string possible. The non-greedy version of the curly brackets, which matches the shortest string possible, has the closing curly bracket followed by a question mark. >>> greedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}') >>> mo1 = greedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa') >>> mo1.group() 'HaHaHaHaHa' >>> nongreedy_ha_regex = re.compile(r'(Ha){3,5}?') >>> mo2 = nongreedy_ha_regex.search('HaHaHaHaHa') >>> mo2.group() 'HaHaHa' Return to the Top The findall() Method In addition to the search() method, Regex objects also have a findall() method. While search() will return a Match object of the first matched text in the searched string, the findall() method will return the strings of every match in the searched string. >>> phone_num_regex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d') # has no groups  >>> phone_num_regex.findall('Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000') ['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000'] To summarize what the findall() method returns, remember the following:   When called on a regex with no groups, such as \d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d, the method findall() returns a list of ng matches, such as ['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000'].   When called on a regex that has groups, such as (\d\d\d)-(d\d)-(\d\d\d\d), the method findall() returns a list of es of strings (one string for each group), such as [('415', '555', '9999'), ('212', '555', '0000')].   Return to the Top Making Your Own Character Classes There are times when you want to match a set of characters but the shorthand character classes (\d, \w, \s, and so on) are too broad. You can define your own character class using square brackets. For example, the character class [aeiouAEIOU] will match any vowel, both lowercase and uppercase. >>> vowel_regex = re.compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')  >>> vowel_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.') ['o', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'o', 'o', 'A', 'O', 'O'] You can also include ranges of letters or numbers by using a hyphen. For example, the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. By placing a caret character (^) just after the character class’s opening bracket, you can make a negative character class. A negative character class will match all the characters that are not in the character class. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell: >>> consonant_regex = re.compile(r'[^aeiouAEIOU]')  >>> consonant_regex.findall('Robocop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.') ['R', 'b', 'c', 'p', ' ', 't', 's', ' ', 'b', 'b', 'y', ' ', 'f', 'd', '.', ' ', 'B', 'B', 'Y', ' ', 'F', 'D', '.'] Return to the Top The Caret and Dollar Sign Characters   You can also use the caret symbol (^) at the start of a regex to indicate that a match must occur at the beginning of the searched text.   Likewise, you can put a dollar sign ($) at the end of the regex to indicate the string must end with this regex pattern.   And you can use the ^ and $ together to indicate that the entire string must match the regex—that is, it’s not enough for a match to be made on some subset of the string.   The r'^Hello' regular expression string matches strings that begin with 'Hello': >>> begins_with_hello = re.compile(r'^Hello')  >>> begins_with_hello.search('Hello world!') <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>  >>> begins_with_hello.search('He said hello.') is None True The r'\d$' regular expression string matches strings that end with a numeric character from 0 to 9: >>> whole_string_is_num = re.compile(r'^\d+$')  >>> whole_string_is_num.search('1234567890') <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 10), match='1234567890'>  >>> whole_string_is_num.search('12345xyz67890') is None True  >>> whole_string_is_num.search('12 34567890') is None True Return to the Top The Wildcard Character The . (or dot) character in a regular expression is called a wildcard and will match any character except for a newline: >>> at_regex = re.compile(r'.at')  >>> at_regex.findall('The cat in the hat sat on the flat mat.') ['cat', 'hat', 'sat', 'lat', 'mat'] Return to the Top Matching Everything with Dot-Star >>> name_regex = re.compile(r'First Name: (.*) Last Name: (.*)')  >>> mo = name_regex.search('First Name: Al Last Name: Sweigart')  >>> mo.group(1) 'Al' >>> mo.group(2) 'Sweigart' The dot-star uses greedy mode: It will always try to match as much text as possible. To match any and all text in a nongreedy fashion, use the dot, star, and question mark (.*?). The question mark tells Python to match in a nongreedy way: >>> nongreedy_regex = re.compile(r'<.*?>') >>> mo = nongreedy_regex.search('<To serve man> for dinner.>') >>> mo.group() '<To serve man>' >>> greedy_regex = re.compile(r'<.*>') >>> mo = greedy_regex.search('<To serve man> for dinner.>') >>> mo.group() '<To serve man> for dinner.>' Return to the Top Matching Newlines with the Dot Character The dot-star will match everything except a newline. By passing re.DOTALL as the second argument to re.compile(), you can make the dot character match all characters, including the newline character: >>> no_newline_regex = re.compile('.*') >>> no_newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group() 'Serve the public trust.' >>> newline_regex = re.compile('.*', re.DOTALL) >>> newline_regex.search('Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.').group() 'Serve the public trust.\nProtect the innocent.\nUphold the law.' Return to the Top Review of Regex Symbols    Symbol Matches     ? zero or one of the preceding group.   * zero or more of the preceding group.   + one or more of the preceding group.   {n} exactly n of the preceding group.   {n,} n or more of the preceding group.   {,m} 0 to m of the preceding group.   {n,m} at least n and at most m of the preceding p.   {n,m}? or *? or +? performs a nongreedy match of the preceding p.   ^spam means the string must begin with spam.   spam$ means the string must end with spam.   . any character, except newline characters.   \d, \w, and \s a digit, word, or space character, respectively.   \D, \W, and \S anything except a digit, word, or space, respectively.   [abc] any character between the brackets (such as a, b, ).   [^abc] any character that isn’t between the brackets.    Return to the Top Case-Insensitive Matching To make your regex case-insensitive, you can pass re.IGNORECASE or re.I as a second argument to re.compile(): >>> robocop = re.compile(r'robocop', re.I)  >>> robocop.search('Robocop is part man, part machine, all cop.').group() 'Robocop' >>> robocop.search('ROBOCOP protects the innocent.').group() 'ROBOCOP' >>> robocop.search('Al, why does your programming book talk about robocop so much?').group() 'robocop' Return to the Top Substituting Strings with the sub() Method The sub() method for Regex objects is passed two arguments:  The first argument is a string to replace any matches. The second is the string for the regular expression.  The sub() method returns a string with the substitutions applied: >>> names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent \w+')  >>> names_regex.sub('CENSORED', 'Agent Alice gave the secret documents to Agent Bob.') 'CENSORED gave the secret documents to CENSORED.' Another example: >>> agent_names_regex = re.compile(r'Agent (\w)\w*')  >>> agent_names_regex.sub(r'\1****', 'Agent Alice told Agent Carol that Agent Eve knew Agent Bob was a double agent.') A**** told C**** that E**** knew B**** was a double agent.' Return to the Top Managing Complex Regexes To tell the re.compile() function to ignore whitespace and comments inside the regular expression string, “verbose mode” can be enabled by passing the variable re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile(). Now instead of a hard-to-read regular expression like this: phone_regex = re.compile(r'((\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?(\s|-|\.)?\d{3}(\s|-|\.)\d{4}(\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?)') you can spread the regular expression over multiple lines with comments like this: phone_regex = re.compile(r'''(     (\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))?            # area code     (\s|-|\.)?                    # separator     \d{3}                         # first 3 digits     (\s|-|\.)                     # separator     \d{4}                         # last 4 digits     (\s*(ext|x|ext.)\s*\d{2,5})?  # extension     )''', re.VERBOSE) Return to the Top Handling File and Directory Paths There are two main modules in Python that deals with path manipulation. One is the os.path module and the other is the pathlib module. The pathlib module was added in Python 3.4, offering an object-oriented way to handle file system paths. Return to the Top Backslash on Windows and Forward Slash on OS X and Linux On Windows, paths are written using backslashes (\) as the separator between folder names. On Unix based operating system such as macOS, Linux, and BSDs, the forward slash (/) is used as the path separator. Joining paths can be a headache if your code needs to work on different platforms. Fortunately, Python provides easy ways to handle this. We will showcase how to deal with this with both os.path.join and pathlib.Path.joinpath Using os.path.join on Windows: >>> import os  >>> os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam') 'usr\\bin\\spam' And using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path  >>> print(Path('usr').joinpath('bin').joinpath('spam')) usr/bin/spam pathlib also provides a shortcut to joinpath using the / operator: >>> from pathlib import Path  >>> print(Path('usr') / 'bin' / 'spam') usr/bin/spam Notice the path separator is different between Windows and Unix based operating system, that's why you want to use one of the above methods instead of adding strings together to join paths together. Joining paths is helpful if you need to create different file paths under the same directory. Using os.path.join on Windows: >>> my_files = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx']  >>> for filename in my_files: >>>     print(os.path.join('C:\\Users\\asweigart', filename)) C:\Users\asweigart\accounts.txt C:\Users\asweigart\details.csv C:\Users\asweigart\invite.docx Using pathlib on *nix: >>> my_files = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx'] >>> home = Path.home() >>> for filename in my_files: >>>     print(home / filename) /home/asweigart/accounts.txt /home/asweigart/details.csv /home/asweigart/invite.docx Return to the Top The Current Working Directory Using os on Windows: >>> import os  >>> os.getcwd() 'C:\\Python34' >>> os.chdir('C:\\Windows\\System32')  >>> os.getcwd() 'C:\\Windows\\System32' Using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> from os import chdir  >>> print(Path.cwd()) /home/asweigart  >>> chdir('/usr/lib/python3.6') >>> print(Path.cwd()) /usr/lib/python3.6 Return to the Top Creating New Folders Using os on Windows: >>> import os >>> os.makedirs('C:\\delicious\\walnut\\waffles') Using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> cwd = Path.cwd() >>> (cwd / 'delicious' / 'walnut' / 'waffles').mkdir() Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>   File ""/usr/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py"", line 1226, in mkdir     self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)   File ""/usr/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py"", line 387, in wrapped     return strfunc(str(pathobj), *args) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/asweigart/delicious/walnut/waffles' Oh no, we got a nasty error! The reason is that the 'delicious' directory does not exist, so we cannot make the 'walnut' and the 'waffles' directories under it. To fix this, do: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> cwd = Path.cwd() >>> (cwd / 'delicious' / 'walnut' / 'waffles').mkdir(parents=True) And all is good :) Return to the Top Absolute vs. Relative Paths There are two ways to specify a file path.  An absolute path, which always begins with the root folder A relative path, which is relative to the program’s current working directory  There are also the dot (.) and dot-dot (..) folders. These are not real folders but special names that can be used in a path. A single period (“dot”) for a folder name is shorthand for “this directory.” Two periods (“dot-dot”) means “the parent folder.” Return to the Top Handling Absolute and Relative Paths To see if a path is an absolute path: Using os.path on *nix: >>> import os >>> os.path.isabs('/') True >>> os.path.isabs('..') False Using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> Path('/').is_absolute() True >>> Path('..').is_absolute() False You can extract an absolute path with both os.path and pathlib Using os.path on *nix: >>> import os >>> os.getcwd() '/home/asweigart' >>> os.path.abspath('..') '/home' Using pathlib on *nix: from pathlib import Path print(Path.cwd()) /home/asweigart print(Path('..').resolve()) /home You can get a relative path from a starting path to another path. Using os.path on *nix: >>> import os >>> os.path.relpath('/etc/passwd', '/') 'etc/passwd' Using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> print(Path('/etc/passwd').relative_to('/')) etc/passwd Return to the Top Checking Path Validity Checking if a file/directory exists: Using os.path on *nix: import os >>> os.path.exists('.')

Using os.path.getsize() and os.listdir() together on Windows: >>> import os >>> total_size = 0  >>> for filename in os.listdir('C:\\Windows\\System32'):       total_size = total_size + os.path.getsize(os.path.join('C:\\Windows\\System32', filename))  >>> print(total_size) 1117846456 Using pathlib on *nix: >>> from pathlib import Path >>> total_size = 0  >>> for sub_path in Path('/usr/bin').iterdir(): ...     total_size += sub_path.stat().st_size >>> >>> print(total_size) 1903178911 Return to the Top Copying Files and Folders The shutil module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders. >>> import shutil, os  >>> os.chdir('C:\\')  >>> shutil.copy('C:\\spam.txt', 'C:\\delicious')    'C:\\delicious\\spam.txt'  >>> shutil.copy('eggs.txt', 'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt')    'C:\\delicious\\eggs2.txt' While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it: >>> import shutil, os  >>> os.chdir('C:\\')  >>> shutil.copytree('C:\\bacon', 'C:\\bacon_backup') 'C:\\bacon_backup' Return to the Top Moving and Renaming Files and Folders >>> import shutil >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs') 'C:\\eggs\\bacon.txt' The destination path can also specify a filename. In the following example, the source file is moved and renamed: >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt') 'C:\\eggs\\new_bacon.txt' If there is no eggs folder, then move() will rename bacon.txt to a file named eggs. >>> shutil.move('C:\\bacon.txt', 'C:\\eggs') 'C:\\eggs' Return to the Top Permanently Deleting Files and Folders   Calling os.unlink(path) or Path.unlink() will delete the file at path.   Calling os.rmdir(path) or Path.rmdir() will delete the folder at path. This folder must be empty of any files or folders.   Calling shutil.rmtree(path) will remove the folder at path, and all files and folders it contains will also be deleted.   Return to the Top Safe Deletes with the send2trash Module You can install this module by running pip install send2trash from a Terminal window. >>> import send2trash  >>> with open('bacon.txt', 'a') as bacon_file: # creates the file ...     bacon_file.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.') 25  >>> send2trash.send2trash('bacon.txt') Return to the Top Walking a Directory Tree >>> import os >>> >>> for folder_name, subfolders, filenames in os.walk('C:\\delicious'): >>>     print('The current folder is {}'.format(folder_name)) >>> >>>     for subfolder in subfolders: >>>         print('SUBFOLDER OF {}: {}'.format(folder_name, subfolder)) >>>     for filename in filenames: >>>         print('FILE INSIDE {}: {}'.format(folder_name, filename)) >>> >>>     print('') The current folder is C:\delicious SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious: cats SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious: walnut FILE INSIDE C:\delicious: spam.txt  The current folder is C:\delicious\cats FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\cats: catnames.txt FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\cats: zophie.jpg  The current folder is C:\delicious\walnut SUBFOLDER OF C:\delicious\walnut: waffles  The current folder is C:\delicious\walnut\waffles FILE INSIDE C:\delicious\walnut\waffles: butter.txt Return to the Top pathlib provides a lot more functionality than the ones listed above, like getting file name, getting file extension, reading/writing a file without manually opening it, etc. Check out the official documentation if you want to know more! Reading and Writing Files The File Reading/Writing Process To read/write to a file in Python, you will want to use the with statement, which will close the file for you after you are done. Return to the Top Opening and reading files with the open() function >>> with open('C:\\Users\\your_home_folder\\hello.txt') as hello_file: ...     hello_content = hello_file.read() >>> hello_content 'Hello World!'  >>> # Alternatively, you can use the *readlines()* method to get a list of string values from the file, one string for each line of text:  >>> with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file: ...     sonnet_file.readlines() [When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n', ' I all alone beweep my outcast state,\n', And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\n', And look upon myself and curse my fate,']  >>> # You can also iterate through the file line by line: >>> with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file: ...     for line in sonnet_file: # note the new line character will be included in the line ...         print(line, end='')  When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself and curse my fate, Return to the Top Writing to Files >>> with open('bacon.txt', 'w') as bacon_file: ...     bacon_file.write('Hello world!\n') 13  >>> with open('bacon.txt', 'a') as bacon_file: ...     bacon_file.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.') 25  >>> with open('bacon.txt') as bacon_file: ...     content = bacon_file.read()  >>> print(content) Hello world! Bacon is not a vegetable. Return to the Top Saving Variables with the shelve Module To save variables: >>> import shelve  >>> cats = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon'] >>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file: ...     shelf_file['cats'] = cats To open and read variables: >>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file: ...     print(type(shelf_file)) ...     print(shelf_file['cats']) <class 'shelve.DbfilenameShelf'> ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon'] Just like dictionaries, shelf values have keys() and values() methods that will return list-like values of the keys and values in the shelf. Since these methods return list-like values instead of true lists, you should pass them to the list() function to get them in list form. >>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file: ...     print(list(shelf_file.keys())) ...     print(list(shelf_file.values())) ['cats'] [['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']] Return to the Top Saving Variables with the pprint.pformat() Function >>> import pprint  >>> cats = [{'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'}, {'name': 'Pooka', 'desc': 'fluffy'}]  >>> pprint.pformat(cats) ""[{'desc': 'chubby', 'name': 'Zophie'}, {'desc': 'fluffy', 'name': 'Pooka'}]""  >>> with open('myCats.py', 'w') as file_obj: ...     file_obj.write('cats = {}\n'.format(pprint.pformat(cats))) 83 Return to the Top Reading ZIP Files >>> import zipfile, os  >>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip >>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip: ...     print(example_zip.namelist()) ...     spam_info = example_zip.getinfo('spam.txt') ...     print(spam_info.file_size) ...     print(spam_info.compress_size) ...     print('Compressed file is %sx smaller!' % (round(spam_info.file_size / spam_info.compress_size, 2)))  ['spam.txt', 'cats/', 'cats/catnames.txt', 'cats/zophie.jpg'] 13908 3828 'Compressed file is 3.63x smaller!' Return to the Top Extracting from ZIP Files The extractall() method for ZipFile objects extracts all the files and folders from a ZIP file into the current working directory. >>> import zipfile, os  >>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip  >>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip: ...     example_zip.extractall() The extract() method for ZipFile objects will extract a single file from the ZIP file. Continue the interactive shell example: >>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip: ...     print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt')) ...     print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt', 'C:\\some\\new\\folders')) 'C:\\spam.txt' 'C:\\some\\new\\folders\\spam.txt' Return to the Top Creating and Adding to ZIP Files >>> import zipfile  >>> with zipfile.ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as new_zip: ...     new_zip.write('spam.txt', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) This code will create a new ZIP file named new.zip that has the compressed contents of spam.txt. Return to the Top JSON, YAML and configuration files JSON Open a JSON file with: import json with open(""filename.json"", ""r"") as f:     content = json.loads(f.read()) Write a JSON file with: import json  content = {""name"": ""Joe"", ""age"": 20} with open(""filename.json"", ""w"") as f:     f.write(json.dumps(content, indent=2)) Return to the Top YAML Compared to JSON, YAML allows for much better human maintainability and gives you the option to add comments. It is a convenient choice for configuration files where humans will have to edit it. There are two main libraries allowing to access to YAML files:  PyYaml Ruamel.yaml  Install them using pip install in your virtual environment. The first one it easier to use but the second one, Ruamel, implements much better the YAML specification, and allow for example to modify a YAML content without altering comments. Open a YAML file with: from ruamel.yaml import YAML  with open(""filename.yaml"") as f:     yaml=YAML()     yaml.load(f) Return to the Top Anyconfig Anyconfig is a very handy package allowing to abstract completely the underlying configuration file format. It allows to load a Python dictionary from JSON, YAML, TOML, and so on. Install it with: pip install anyconfig Usage: import anyconfig  conf1 = anyconfig.load(""/path/to/foo/conf.d/a.yml"") Return to the Top Debugging Raising Exceptions Exceptions are raised with a raise statement. In code, a raise statement consists of the following:  The raise keyword A call to the Exception() function A string with a helpful error message passed to the Exception() function  >>> raise Exception('This is the error message.') Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<pyshell#191>"", line 1, in <module>     raise Exception('This is the error message.') Exception: This is the error message. Often it’s the code that calls the function, not the function itself, that knows how to handle an exception. So you will commonly see a raise statement inside a function and the try and except statements in the code calling the function. def box_print(symbol, width, height):     if len(symbol) != 1:       raise Exception('Symbol must be a single character string.')     if width <= 2:       raise Exception('Width must be greater than 2.')     if height <= 2:       raise Exception('Height must be greater than 2.')     print(symbol * width)     for i in range(height - 2):         print(symbol + (' ' * (width - 2)) + symbol)     print(symbol * width) for sym, w, h in (('*', 4, 4), ('O', 20, 5), ('x', 1, 3), ('ZZ', 3, 3)):     try:         box_print(sym, w, h)     except Exception as err:         print('An exception happened: ' + str(err)) Return to the Top Getting the Traceback as a String The traceback is displayed by Python whenever a raised exception goes unhandled. But can also obtain it as a string by calling traceback.format_exc(). This function is useful if you want the information from an exception’s traceback but also want an except statement to gracefully handle the exception. You will need to import Python’s traceback module before calling this function. >>> import traceback  >>> try: >>>      raise Exception('This is the error message.') >>> except: >>>      with open('errorInfo.txt', 'w') as error_file: >>>          error_file.write(traceback.format_exc()) >>>      print('The traceback info was written to errorInfo.txt.') 116 The traceback info was written to errorInfo.txt. The 116 is the return value from the write() method, since 116 characters were written to the file. The traceback text was written to errorInfo.txt. Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<pyshell#28>"", line 2, in <module> Exception: This is the error message.  Return to the Top Assertions An assertion is a sanity check to make sure your code isn’t doing something obviously wrong. These sanity checks are performed by assert statements. If the sanity check fails, then an AssertionError exception is raised. In code, an assert statement consists of the following:  The assert keyword A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False) A comma A string to display when the condition is False  >>> pod_bay_door_status = 'open'  >>> assert pod_bay_door_status == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be ""open"".'  >>> pod_bay_door_status = 'I\'m sorry, Dave. I\'m afraid I can\'t do that.'  >>> assert pod_bay_door_status == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be ""open"".'  Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<pyshell#10>"", line 1, in <module>     assert pod_bay_door_status == 'open', 'The pod bay doors need to be ""open"".' AssertionError: The pod bay doors need to be ""open"". In plain English, an assert statement says, “I assert that this condition holds true, and if not, there is a bug somewhere in the program.” Unlike exceptions, your code should not handle assert statements with try and except; if an assert fails, your program should crash. By failing fast like this, you shorten the time between the original cause of the bug and when you first notice the bug. This will reduce the amount of code you will have to check before finding the code that’s causing the bug. Disabling Assertions Assertions can be disabled by passing the -O option when running Python. Return to the Top Logging To enable the logging module to display log messages on your screen as your program runs, copy the following to the top of your program (but under the #! python shebang line): import logging  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s- %(message)s') Say you wrote a function to calculate the factorial of a number. In mathematics, factorial 4 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4, or 24. Factorial 7 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7, or 5,040. Open a new file editor window and enter the following code. It has a bug in it, but you will also enter several log messages to help yourself figure out what is going wrong. Save the program as factorialLog.py. >>> import logging >>> >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s- %(message)s') >>> >>> logging.debug('Start of program') >>> >>> def factorial(n): >>> >>>     logging.debug('Start of factorial(%s)' % (n)) >>>     total = 1 >>> >>>     for i in range(1, n + 1): >>>         total *= i >>>         logging.debug('i is ' + str(i) + ', total is ' + str(total)) >>> >>>     logging.debug('End of factorial(%s)' % (n)) >>> >>>     return total >>> >>> print(factorial(5)) >>> logging.debug('End of program') 2015-05-23 16:20:12,664 - DEBUG - Start of program 2015-05-23 16:20:12,664 - DEBUG - Start of factorial(5) 2015-05-23 16:20:12,665 - DEBUG - i is 0, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,668 - DEBUG - i is 1, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,670 - DEBUG - i is 2, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,673 - DEBUG - i is 3, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,675 - DEBUG - i is 4, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,678 - DEBUG - i is 5, total is 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,680 - DEBUG - End of factorial(5) 0 2015-05-23 16:20:12,684 - DEBUG - End of program Return to the Top Logging Levels Logging levels provide a way to categorize your log messages by importance. There are five logging levels, described in Table 10-1 from least to most important. Messages can be logged at each level using a different logging function.    Level Logging Function Description     DEBUG logging.debug() The lowest level. Used for small details. Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.   INFO logging.info() Used to record information on general events in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the program.   WARNING logging.warning() Used to indicate a potential problem that doesn’t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.   ERROR logging.error() Used to record an error that caused the program to fail to do something.   CRITICAL logging.critical() The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running entirely.    Return to the Top Disabling Logging After you’ve debugged your program, you probably don’t want all these log messages cluttering the screen. The logging.disable() function disables these so that you don’t have to go into your program and remove all the logging calls by hand. >>> import logging  >>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=' %(asctime)s -%(levelname)s - %(message)s')  >>> logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!') 2015-05-22 11:10:48,054 - CRITICAL - Critical error! Critical error!  >>> logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)  >>> logging.critical('Critical error! Critical error!')  >>> logging.error('Error! Error!') Return to the Top Logging to a File Instead of displaying the log messages to the screen, you can write them to a text file. The logging.basicConfig() function takes a filename keyword argument, like so: import logging  logging.basicConfig(filename='myProgramLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') Return to the Top Lambda Functions This function: >>> def add(x, y):         return x + y  >>> add(5, 3) 8 Is equivalent to the lambda function: >>> add = lambda x, y: x + y >>> add(5, 3) 8 It's not even need to bind it to a name like add before: >>> (lambda x, y: x + y)(5, 3) 8 Like regular nested functions, lambdas also work as lexical closures: >>> def make_adder(n):         return lambda x: x + n  >>> plus_3 = make_adder(3) >>> plus_5 = make_adder(5)  >>> plus_3(4) 7 >>> plus_5(4) 9 Note: lambda can only evaluate an expression, like a single line of code. Return to the Top Ternary Conditional Operator Many programming languages have a ternary operator, which define a conditional expression. The most common usage is to make a terse simple conditional assignment statement. In other words, it offers one-line code to evaluate the first expression if the condition is true, otherwise it evaluates the second expression. <expression1> if <condition> else <expression2>  Example: >>> age = 15  >>> print('kid' if age < 18 else 'adult') kid Ternary operators can be chained: >>> age = 15  >>> print('kid' if age < 13 else 'teenager' if age < 18 else 'adult') teenager The code above is equivalent to: if age < 18:     if age < 13:         print('kid')     else:         print('teenager') else:     print('adult') Return to the Top args and kwargs The names args and kwargs are arbitrary - the important thing are the * and ** operators. They can mean:   In a function declaration, * means “pack all remaining positional arguments into a tuple named <name>”, while ** is the same for keyword arguments (except it uses a dictionary, not a tuple).   In a function call, * means “unpack tuple or list named <name> to positional arguments at this position”, while ** is the same for keyword arguments.   For example you can make a function that you can use to call any other function, no matter what parameters it has: def forward(f, *args, **kwargs):     return f(*args, **kwargs) Inside forward, args is a tuple (of all positional arguments except the first one, because we specified it - the f), kwargs is a dict. Then we call f and unpack them so they become normal arguments to f. You use *args when you have an indefinite amount of positional arguments. >>> def fruits(*args): >>>    for fruit in args: >>>       print(fruit)  >>> fruits(""apples"", ""bananas"", ""grapes"")  ""apples"" ""bananas"" ""grapes"" Similarly, you use **kwargs when you have an indefinite number of keyword arguments. >>> def fruit(**kwargs): >>>    for key, value in kwargs.items(): >>>        print(""{0}: {1}"".format(key, value))  >>> fruit(name = ""apple"", color = ""red"")  name: apple color: red >>> def show(arg1, arg2, *args, kwarg1=None, kwarg2=None, **kwargs): >>>   print(arg1) >>>   print(arg2) >>>   print(args) >>>   print(kwarg1) >>>   print(kwarg2) >>>   print(kwargs)  >>> data1 = [1,2,3] >>> data2 = [4,5,6] >>> data3 = {'a':7,'b':8,'c':9}  >>> show(*data1,*data2, kwarg1=""python"",kwarg2=""cheatsheet"",**data3) 1 2 (3, 4, 5, 6) python cheatsheet {'a': 7, 'b': 8, 'c': 9}  >>> show(*data1, *data2, **data3) 1 2 (3, 4, 5, 6) None None {'a': 7, 'b': 8, 'c': 9}  # If you do not specify ** for kwargs >>> show(*data1, *data2, *data3) 1 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, ""a"", ""b"", ""c"") None None {} Things to Remember(args)  Functions can accept a variable number of positional arguments by using *args in the def statement. You can use the items from a sequence as the positional arguments for a function with the * operator. Using the * operator with a generator may cause your program to run out of memory and crash. Adding new positional parameters to functions that accept *args can introduce hard-to-find bugs.  Things to Remember(kwargs)  Function arguments can be specified by position or by keyword. Keywords make it clear what the purpose of each argument is when it would be confusing with only positional arguments. Keyword arguments with default values make it easy to add new behaviors to a function, especially when the function has existing callers. Optional keyword arguments should always be passed by keyword instead of by position.  Return to the Top Context Manager While Python's context managers are widely used, few understand the purpose behind their use. These statements, commonly used with reading and writing files, assist the application in conserving system memory and improve resource management by ensuring specific resources are only in use for certain processes. with statement A context manager is an object that is notified when a context (a block of code) starts and ends. You commonly use one with the with statement. It takes care of the notifying. For example, file objects are context managers. When a context ends, the file object is closed automatically: >>> with open(filename) as f: >>>     file_contents = f.read()  # the open_file object has automatically been closed. Anything that ends execution of the block causes the context manager's exit method to be called. This includes exceptions, and can be useful when an error causes you to prematurely exit from an open file or connection. Exiting a script without properly closing files/connections is a bad idea, that may cause data loss or other problems. By using a context manager you can ensure that precautions are always taken to prevent damage or loss in this way. Writing your own contextmanager using generator syntax It is also possible to write a context manager using generator syntax thanks to the contextlib.contextmanager decorator: >>> import contextlib >>> @contextlib.contextmanager ... def context_manager(num): ...     print('Enter') ...     yield num + 1 ...     print('Exit') >>> with context_manager(2) as cm: ...     # the following instructions are run when the 'yield' point of the context ...     # manager is reached. ...     # 'cm' will have the value that was yielded ...     print('Right in the middle with cm = {}'.format(cm)) Enter Right in the middle with cm = 3 Exit  >>> Return to the Top __main__ Top-level script environment __main__ is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A module’s name is set equal to __main__ when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt. A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by checking its own __name__, which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with python -m but not when it is imported: >>> if __name__ == ""__main__"": ...     # execute only if run as a script ...     main() For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a main.py module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with -m For example we are developing script which is designed to be used as module, we should do: >>> # Python program to execute function directly >>> def add(a, b): ...     return a+b ... >>> add(10, 20) # we can test it by calling the function save it as calculate.py 30 >>> # Now if we want to use that module by importing we have to comment out our call, >>> # Instead we can write like this in calculate.py >>> if __name__ == ""__main__"": ...     add(3, 5) ... >>> import calculate >>> calculate.add(3, 5) 8 Advantages  Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is __main__, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions. If you import this script as a module in another script, the name is set to the name of the script/module. Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs. if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.  Return to the Top setup.py The setup script is the centre of all activity in building, distributing, and installing modules using the Distutils. The main purpose of the setup script is to describe your module distribution to the Distutils, so that the various commands that operate on your modules do the right thing. The setup.py file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes all of the metadata about your project. There a quite a few fields you can add to a project to give it a rich set of metadata describing the project. However, there are only three required fields: name, version, and packages. The name field must be unique if you wish to publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The version field keeps track of different releases of the project. The packages field describes where you’ve put the Python source code within your project. This allows you to easily install Python packages. Often it's enough to write: python setup.py install and module will install itself. Our initial setup.py will also include information about the license and will re-use the README.txt file for the long_description field. This will look like: >>> from distutils.core import setup >>> setup( ...    name='pythonCheatsheet', ...    version='0.1', ...    packages=['pipenv',], ...    license='MIT', ...    long_description=open('README.txt').read(), ... ) Find more information visit http://docs.python.org/install/index.html. Return to the Top Dataclasses Dataclasses are python classes but are suited for storing data objects. This module provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding generated special methods such as __init__() and __repr__() to user-defined classes. Features   They store data and represent a certain data type. Ex: A number. For people familiar with ORMs, a model instance is a data object. It represents a specific kind of entity. It holds attributes that define or represent the entity.   They can be compared to other objects of the same type. Ex: A number can be greater than, less than, or equal to another number.   Python 3.7 provides a decorator dataclass that is used to convert a class into a dataclass. python 2.7 >>> class Number: ...     def __init__(self, val): ...         self.val = val ... >>> obj = Number(2) >>> obj.val 2 with dataclass >>> @dataclass ... class Number: ...     val: int ... >>> obj = Number(2) >>> obj.val 2 Return to the Top Default values It is easy to add default values to the fields of your data class. >>> @dataclass ... class Product: ...     name: str ...     count: int = 0 ...     price: float = 0.0 ... >>> obj = Product(""Python"") >>> obj.name Python >>> obj.count 0 >>> obj.price 0.0 Type hints It is mandatory to define the data type in dataclass. However, If you don't want specify the datatype then, use typing.Any. >>> from dataclasses import dataclass >>> from typing import Any  >>> @dataclass ... class WithoutExplicitTypes: ...    name: Any ...    value: Any = 42 ... Return to the Top Virtual Environment The use of a Virtual Environment is to test python code in encapsulated environments and to also avoid filling the base Python installation with libraries we might use for only one project. Return to the Top virtualenv   Install virtualenv pip install virtualenv    Install virtualenvwrapper-win (Windows) pip install virtualenvwrapper-win    Usage:   Make a Virtual Environment mkvirtualenv HelloWold  Anything we install now will be specific to this project. And available to the projects we connect to this environment.   Set Project Directory To bind our virtualenv with our current working directory we simply enter: setprojectdir .    Deactivate To move onto something else in the command line type ‘deactivate’ to deactivate your environment. deactivate  Notice how the parenthesis disappear.

The task is to create an AI for the classification of traffic signs, the 'model' file is a ready trained model and the prediction is done in 'PublicAPI.py'. The API itself is written in Python using the Flask framework The API should receive an image of a road turn sign as input (it can consist of several signs) and send the name of the signs from left to right.  We will use our own computer as a server and ngrok as a proxy. ngrok - https://ngrok.com/download With 'PublicAPI.py' we start a local server  Next, open ngrok.exe and run the proxy with the command: 'ngrok http your_port', in our case our port is 4567, in response we will receive the URL  We will check the functionality of the API using the 'TestPublicAPI.py' file, we send a request with a photo to the URL received from ngrok.  Also we can just go to the received URL and send the file manually

Background Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: ""What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"" Now, we know what you may be thinking: ""Duh. It gets hotter..."" But, if pressed, how would you prove it?  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: WeatherPy.   Inside the folder that you just created, add new files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.   Push the above changes to GitHub.   Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualise the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilising a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. Your first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analysing. Your second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression is modelling such as any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have. Your final notebook must:  Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name. Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.  Part II - VacationPy Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.   Note: Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform Billing and Manage your cost of use for more information.   Note: if you having trouble displaying the maps try running jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and retry.   Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from the part I of the homework.    Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:   A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.   Wind speed less than 10 mph.   Zero cloudiness.   Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.   Note: Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.     Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.   Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.    As final considerations:  Create a new GitHub repository for this project called API-Challenge (note the kebab-case). Do not add to an existing repo You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook. You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries. For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission. You must use proper labelling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels. For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.  Hints and Considerations   The city data you generate is based on random coordinates as well as different query times; as such, your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.   You may want to start this assignment by refreshing yourself on the geographic coordinate system.   Next, spend the requisite time necessary to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer  basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should be aiming to have a crystal clear understanding of your intended outcome.   A starter code for Citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works: citipy Python library. Before you try to incorporate the library into your analysis, start by creating simple test cases outside your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Too often, when introduced to a new library, students get bogged down by the most minor of errors -- spending hours investigating their entire code -- when, in fact, a simple and focused test would have shown their basic utilisation of the library was wrong from the start. Don't let this be you!   Part of our expectation in this challenge is that you will use critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending the tools we are. What is Citipy for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?   In building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you getting coverage of the full gamut of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you simply choosing 500 cities concentrated in one region of the world? Even if you were a geographic genius, simply rattling 500 cities based on your human selection would create a biased dataset. Be thinking of how you should counter this. (Hint: Consider the full range of latitudes).   Once you have computed the linear regression for one chart, the process will be similar for all others. As a bonus, try to create a function that will create these charts based on different parameters.   Remember that each coordinate will trigger a separate call to the Google API. If you're creating your own criteria to plan your vacation, try to reduce the results in your DataFrame to 10 or fewer cities.   Lastly, remember -- this is a challenging activity. Push yourself! If you complete this task, then you can safely say that you've gained a strong mastery of the core foundations of data analytics and it will only go better from here. Good luck!

Your code will use the drink maker protocol to send commands to the drink maker. First iteration - Making drinks In this iteration, your task is to implement the logic (starting from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol (see below) to send commands to the drink maker. The coffee machine can serves 3 type of drinks: tea, coffee, chocolate. Use cases Your product owner has delivered the stories and here they are:  The drink maker should receive the correct instructions for my coffee / tea / chocolate order I want to be able to send instructions to the drink maker to add one or two sugars When my order contains sugar the drink maker should add a stick (touillette) with it  Drink maker protocol The drink maker receives string commands from your code to make the drinks. It can also deliver info messages to the customer if ordered so. The instructions it receives follow this format: ""T:1:0"" (Drink maker makes 1 tea with 1 sugar and a stick) ""H::"" (Drink maker makes 1 chocolate with no sugar and therefore no stick) ""C:2:0"" (Drink maker makes 1 coffee with 2 sugars and a stick) ""M:message-content"" (Drink maker forwards any message received onto the coffee machine interface for the customer to see)  Second iteration - Going into business The coffee machine is not free anymore! One tea is 0,4 euro, a coffee is 0,6 euro, a chocolate is 0,5 euro. The drink maker will now only make a drink if enough money is given for it Use cases  The drink maker should make the drinks only if the correct amount of money is given If not enough money is provided, we want to send a message to the drink maker. The message should contains at least the amount of money missing.  Important Remember that the drink maker forwards any message received onto the coffee machine interface for the customer to see. If too much money is given, the drink maker will still make the drink according to the instructions. The machine will handle the return of the correct change. So do not worry about that. You don't need to worry if there is too much money inserted. Just make sure, the minimum amount of money is set. Third iteration - Extra hot The machine has been upgraded and the drink maker is now able to make orange juice and to deliver extra hot drinks. You have to update your code to send the correct messages to the drink maker so that users can have orange juices or extra hot drinks Let us see if your implementation is flexible enough to welcome those changes with not too much hassle. Use cases  I want to be able to buy a orange juice for 0,6 euro I want to be able to have my coffee, chocolate or tea extra hot  Implementation details Here are the new protocol commands added to the new firmware of the drink maker: ""O::"" (Drink maker will make one orange juice) ""Ch::"" (Drink maker will make an extra hot coffee with no sugar) ""Hh:1:0"" (Drink maker will make an extra hot chocolate with one sugar and a stick) ""Th:2:0"" (The drink maker will make an extra hot tea with two sugar and a stick)  Fourth iteration - Making money The machine is becoming popular in the office. The management is eager to have daily reports of what is sold and when. Use cases  I want to be able to print a report anytime that contains: how many of each drink was sold and the total amount of money earned so far.  ##Implementation details For the reporting, you can have a repository of data with a simple data structure in memory. A simple reporting can be done by printing to the console. Of course all of that should be tested before it is written, but you know that already, don't you ? ;) Fifth iteration - Running out The users of the coffee machine are complaining that there is often shortages of water and/or milk. It takes weeks before the machine is refilled. Your product owner wants to you to take advantage of the machine capabilities to inform the user that there is a shortage and to send a email notification to the company so that they can come and refill the machine. Use cases When I order a drink and it can be delivered because of a shortage, I want to see a message to the coffee machine console that indicates me the shortage and that a notification has been sent Implementation details You can take advantages of the 2 services implemented by the coffee machine: public interface EmailNotifier {     void notifyMissingDrink(String drink) }  public interface BeverageQuantityChecker {     boolean isEmpty(String drink) }  "

Background Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: ""What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"" Now, we know what you may be thinking: ""Duh. It gets hotter..."" But, if pressed, how would you prove it?  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside the repository folder you just created, add new files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.   Push the above changes to GitHub.   Adding A .gitignore File We don't want the api_keys.py file containing the API key to be exposed to the public on GitHub, as this would mean anyone could copy and use our API key, possibly causing us to incur charges. When we type git status in the command line, we can see all the files we have created so far that are untracked. If we only wanted to add the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub we could type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. However, every time we want to add a new file or update current files to the repository, we have to add each file individually, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, we can add the files we don't want to track to the .gitignore file. Before we add our files to GitHub, let's add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file. Follow these steps:   Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.   Open the .gitignore file, and on the first line type the following:   # Adding config.py file. api_keys.py   While the .gitignore file is open, add the API_practice.ipynb and random_numbers.ipynb files and save the file.   In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should say the .gitignore file has been modified and the WeatherPy.ipynb file is untracked.   Use git add, git commit, and git push to commit the modifications to .gitignore and the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub.   On GitHub, the only new file you should see is the WeatherPy.ipynb file. Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing. The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each pair of plots, take the time to explain what the linear regression is modeling. For example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have. Your final notebook must:  Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name. Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.  Part II - VacationPy Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.   Note: Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform Billing and Manage your cost of use for more information.   Note: if you having trouble displaying the maps, try running jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and retry.   To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:   Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.    Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:   A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.   Wind speed less than 10 mph.   Zero cloudiness.   Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.   Note: Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.     Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.   Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.    As final considerations:  You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook. You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries. For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission. You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels. For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.  Hints and Considerations   The city data you generate is based on random coordinates as well as different query times. As such, your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.   If you'd like a refresher on the geographic coordinate system, this site has great information.   Next, spend the requisite time necessary to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should be aiming to have a crystal clear understanding of your intended outcome.   A starter code for Citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works: citipy Python library. Before you try to incorporate the library into your analysis, start by creating simple test cases outside your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Too often, when introduced to a new library, students get bogged down by the most minor of errors -- spending hours investigating their entire code -- when, in fact, a simple and focused test would have shown their basic utilization of the library was wrong from the start. Don't let this be you!   Part of our expectation in this challenge is that you will use critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending the tools we are. What is Citipy for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?   In building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you getting coverage of the full gamut of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you simply choosing 500 cities concentrated in one region of the world? Even if you were a geographic genius, simply rattling 500 cities based on your human selection would create a biased dataset. Be thinking of how you should counter this. (Hint: Consider the full range of latitudes).   Once you have computed the linear regression for one chart, the process will be similar for all others. As a bonus, try to create a function that will create these charts based on different parameters.   Remember that each coordinate will trigger a separate call to the Google API. If you're creating your own criteria to plan your vacation, try to reduce the results in your DataFrame to 10 or fewer cities.   Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file.   Lastly, remember -- this is a challenging activity. Push yourself! If you complete this task, then you can safely say that you've gained a strong mastery of the core foundations of data analytics and it will only go better from here. Good luck!

Description of the Project: In this project, I have made a game on Python using Turtle Graphics. In this game, we need to choose the no of sticks from the left side, and then the computer would also choose the number of sticks and remove it (it will do the same from right). The one, who removed the last stick wins. Requirements:  Python IDLE (any version). Visual Studio Code by Microsoft (You can use any other IDLE too, but I recommend to use this one)  Codes: You can get the codes of the project here. Some glimpses of the project: You can get the glimpse of the Project here:

Humongous amounts of video content getting generated on a daily basis by organization, analyzing them is one of the biggest challenges. We need to build a content recommendation engine with user’s viewing history and preferences. This will simplify content discovery for your users and guide them to the most relevant content that they want which in return saves organization time to analyse the popular/best videos. Machine Learning algorithm used is NLP and TFID. HTML and CSS is used to design the page. Deployment Deployed the model in streamlit. As this is easy platform to deploy the model. To search the videos we exrtracted some keywords, if user search a video using keywords video will appear. And user will get some recommedation related user's searched videos. Some variable had special characters and emoticons, we clean the data removed special characters and emoticons, using feature selection can reduce unnecessary variables from the dataset. So we created keyword variable as a target variable.

All news are not real, right? How will you detect fake news? The answer is Python. By practicing this advanced python project of detecting fake news, you will easily make a difference between real and fake news. Before moving ahead in this machine learning project, get aware of the terms related to it like fake news, tfidfvectorizer, PassiveAggressive Classifier. What is a TfidfVectorizer? TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms. IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus. The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. What is a PassiveAggressiveClassifier? Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector. Detecting Fake News with Python: To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. About Detecting Fake News with Python This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares. The fake news Dataset: The dataset we’ll use for this python project- we’ll call it news.csv. This dataset has a shape of 7796×4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE. Project Prerequisites: You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip: pip install numpy pandas sklearn You’ll need to install Jupyter Lab to run your code. Get to your command prompt and run the following command: C:\Users\DataFlair>jupyter lab You’ll see a new browser window open up; create a new console and use it to run your code.

This project utilizes a read-eval-print loop to parse user input in the scheme language and evaluate it internally using Python. Implementation Overview: Read: This step parses user input (a string of Scheme code) into the interpreter's internal Python representation of Scheme expressions (e.g. Pairs). Lexical analysis occurs in scheme_tokens.py. This function returns a Buffer (from buffer.py) of tokens. Syntactic analysis happens in scheme_reader.py, in the scheme_read and read_tail functions. Together, these mutually recursive functions parse Scheme tokens into the interpreter's internal Python representation of Scheme expressions. Eval: This step evaluates Scheme expressions (represented in Python) to obtain values. Code for this step is in the main scheme.py file. Print: This step prints the str representation of the obtained value. Loop: The logic for the loop is handled by the read_eval_print_loop function in scheme.py.    File Description     scheme.py implements the REPL and a evaluator for Scheme expressions   scheme_reader.py implements the reader for Scheme input. The Pair class and nil definition can be found here.   scheme_tokens.py implements the tokenizer for Scheme input   scheme_builtins.py implements built-in Scheme procedures in Python   buffer.py implements the Buffer class, used in scheme_reader.py   ucb.py utility functions for use in 61A projects    Running the interpreter: To start an interactive Scheme interpreter session, type: python3 scheme.py

This endpoint has been developed in adherence with the IndieAuth specification, a method of authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0. Using this project, you can authenticate yourself to a service by using RelMeAuth. RelMeAuth requires you have rel=""me"" links on your blog that link to social profiles. At the moment, this project only supports the following rel=me links:  GitHub Twitter  You can also authenticate using Okta Verify's passwordless solution. To do so, you will need to have an active Okta developer account. Screenshot  Setup To setup this project, first install the required dependencies. You can do this using the following command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt  Next, you will need to add some configration variables to a file called config.py. Create a file called config.py in the root directory of the project. Add the following value to the file: ME=""https://yourdomain.com""  Next, add your Twitter API keys to the file like so (leave all values you do not want to specify as """"): TWITTER_OAUTH_KEY=""KEY"" TWITTER_OAUTH_SECRET=""SECRET""  These values can be obtained from Twitter. You will need a Twitter Developer account to obtain these values. Then add your GitHub OAuth API keys (leave all values you do not want to specify as """"): GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = ""ID"" GITHUB_OAUTH_REDIRECT = ""URL"" GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = ""SECRET""  You can retrieve these pieces of information by following the GitHub ""Creating an OAuth App"" guide. Next, add your Okta API keys (leave all values you do not want to specify as """"): OKTA_DOMAIN = ""DOMAIN"" OKTA_ACCESS_TOKEN = ""TOKEN"" OKTA_USER_ID = ""ID"" OKTA_FACTOR_ID = ""ID""  You can learn more about Okta and their APIs by reading the Okta API documentation. Using the keys above, this application will be able to authenticate you using Twitter, GitHub, and Okta. Finally, add a secret key to your config.py file: SECRET_KEY = ""KEY""  This key is used by Flask and is required for this web application to run. Your secret key must be kept secret. Next, run the IndieAuth server using Flask: python3 app.py  If you plan to deploy the server on production, please use an appropriate production deployment method (i.e. using Gunicorn) as you would for any other Flask application.

Description of the data set Through the UCI ML Repository,* we selected a dataset detailing red vinho (wine) samples from the north of Portugal. The datasets contained 12 attributes based on physicochemical tests ranging from: fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid residual sugar chlorides free sulfur dioxide total sulfur dioxide density pH Sulphates alcohol level quality Results We applied classification to answer how several variables are related --  specifically how the 11 categorized features of our data set impacts quality of wine. Comparing the two models, we have found that they are more or less equally accurate in predicting new data although we would consider Logistic Regression as the better model due to the higher AOC score it produces.

I don't have any code to push yet but I'm working on the architecture of the database. I will then update the README to let you inform about my thought and progress. Do not hesitate to send me an email if you want to join the project :) Introduction FlashDB is a lightweight schemaless oriented database optimized for reading. It's written in pure Python. You can use Flash DB if:  You need a small database without 10000 external dependencies. You need fast read You have no schema and no need to JOIN between your entities You want to test an open source project :D You don't need complexe queries like multiple aggregations or Multiple subqueries You want to deploy your application fast  Supported Python Versions QuickStart TODO Contributing Whether reporting bugs, discussing improvements and new ideas or writing extensions: Contributions to FlashDB are welcome! Here's how to get started:  Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug Fork the repository on Github, create a new branch off the master branch and start making your changes (known as GitHub Flow) Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published ☺

417868191;edit-reverse-proxy;https://github.com/sulliops/edit-reverse-proxy;CSS;2021-10-16T15:26:33Z;0;0;0;"edit-reverse-proxy edit-reverse-proxy is a combination of scripts meant to make creating a single NGINX reverse proxy easier. Where normally a user would edit NGINX configuration files through the command-line interface, these scripts automate the process and allow users to enter port numbers for the port being exposed and the port being proxied through a simple web-based interface. This repository was developed as part of CUHackIt Hello World 2021 over the course of eight hours. Below is a list of each major file and its function: makefile The makefile runs Linux commands which copy the contents of webdocs and the edit-reverse-proxy.py script into absolute locations for use and editing, and it sets permissions for individual files so that NGINX and Python can access/modify them. Note: part of the makefile's configuration procedure is setting the NGINX user www-data to NOPASSWD in the /etc/sudoers file, to enable PHP to run edit-reverse-proxy.py as root. This may be considered insecure, and you shouldn't use these scripts if you're concerned about this vulnerability. configure-nginx.py This script installs NGINX and PHP-FPM, and sets NGINX's default configuration files to enable the execution of PHP scripts on the web server. Additionally, this script creates the edit-reverse-proxy.conf file which stores the configuration for the reverse proxy. index.html The index.html file (and its associated CSS/JS/favicon) are the front-end for this script that allows users to simply input the appropriate port numbers in an easy-to-understand interface. There is an associated function, sendVarsToPHP(), which redirects the browser to passvars.php with user-inputted parameters. success.html The success.html file displays the success message called by passvars.php. passvars.php passvars.php interprets URL paramaters as variables, then passes the variables (user input) to edit-reverse-proxy.py as arguments for interpretation. A front-end ""success"" page is also displayed, dependent on success.html. edit-reverse-proxy.py This script gets the current contents of edit-reverse-proxy.conf, converts the contents to a line-by-line array, then modifies the contents of certain lines to match user input. The script then writes the array line-by-line back to edit-reverse-proxy.conf and restarts the NGINX service. Usage Prior to running the scripts, run the following: apt-get update  This is excluded from the makefile because some systems may encounter errors with custom PPAs that prevent the makefile from continuing. Clone the repository to a local folder and cd: git clone https://github.com/sulliops/edit-reverse-proxy.git cd edit-reverse-proxy/  Run the makefile: make build  Note: depending on your current Linux permissions, you may need to run the above as root. Visit the newly-created web server at http://localhost:8080 and begin interacting with the scripts. Important note This script will destroy any changes made to the default NGINX configuration. In addition, overwriting this script's default port using listenOn will result in an NGINX misconfiguration; you can fix this by re-running the makefile, but this will destroy any modifications you've made since last running it. Editing configure-nginx.py to run the script on a port other than default will free up that port, assuming no other program tries to bind to it.

417835127;durchsage;https://github.com/chaoswest-tv/durchsage;Python;2021-10-16T13:23:01Z;0;0;0;"durchsage Daemon that will follow a pretalx conference schedule.json (""fahrplan"") and make announcements (""durchsage"") on a MQTT topic when an event starts. architecture The whole daemon is based around a blocking scheduler based on APscheduler. When launched, it will set up a update_event_jobs cron schedule per configured fahrplan. When this cron is invoked, it will fetch the current fahrplan from the source url, and filter out all events/talks in the past. For each remaining event a new announce_event job will be generated that sends out the job data to an MQTT topic exactly when the event starts. It will use these MQTT topics:  fahrplan/<fahrplan>/version: When a schedule with a different version has been imported, a message containing the version string will be published here. fahrplan/<fahrplan>/now: When an event begins the whole event data structure is dumped in JSON and published here. fahrplan/<fahrplan>/soon: (Optional) Just before an event begins the whole event data structure is dumped in JSON and published here. You can configure how many minutes before the actual event start this will happen, or not at all.  configuration Create a config.ini and either drop it in the same folder as durchsage.py or pass the path with a --config flag. There can be only one mqtt section defining the connection parameters to the broker. There can be many fahrplan:<fahrplan> sections, where <fahrplan> is a user definable name. This will be used internally and for the MQTT topic selection. <fahrplan> needs to begin with a lowercase letter or digit, and can contain lowercase letters, digits, dashes or underscores after the first char.

You are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on the data source site. This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling. Project Tasks Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using kubernetes, which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:  Test your project code using linting Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction Improve the log statements in the source code for this application Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested  You can find a detailed project rubric, here. The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.  Setup the Environment  Create a virtualenv and activate it Run make install to install the necessary dependencies  Running app.py  Standalone:  python app.py Run in Docker:  ./run_docker.sh Run in Kubernetes:  ./run_kubernetes.sh  Kubernetes Steps  Setup and Configure Docker locally Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally Create Flask app in Container Run via kubectl

Simple is as a Python-powered markdown blog. You can see an example running on my blog. The editor is an expanding textarea and you can upload images by dragging and dropping them onto the page, and ctrl+s saves the post. You can also add a header image to any post by selecting the image icon in the top right. This lets you browse through the latest Bing daily images, and in the future you will be able to upload your own. Quickstart: It's supposed to be easy to set up Simple. If you don't think it is then open a ticket and let me know. Simple is designed to be served via Gunicorn, behind nginx. You can optionally use supervisord to manage the gunicorn processes. You need Python 3.4, and simply follow the commands below (nginx on Ubuntu uses /sites-available/ instead of /conf.d/): >> mkdir blog && cd blog >> python3.4 -m venv env >> source env/bin/activate && pip install simpleblogging gunicorn >> simple create >> nano simple_config.py >> simple nginx_config yoursite.com --proxy_port=9009 > /etc/nginx/conf.d/simple.conf >> simple supervisor_config env/ 9009 >> /etc/supervisord.conf >> chown -R nobody:nobody ../blog >> supervisorctl start simple && service nginx reload

The approach is somewhat inspired by a Python script by rajbot, but written from scratch. This script is useful only if you have access to the UseMod wiki's data directory. The main use case for it is to convert a UseMod wiki to one of the current crop of static site content managers (static SCM). You will almost certainly need to tweak the script to adapt it both to your wiki's usage patterns and your SCM's conventions. No attempt is made to preserve historical edits. UseMod was designed to keep only the most recent few edits of a page anyway.

Those are MVC architecture,ORM(object-relational mapping),routers,templating engine,security,and more. Full-stack frameworks are sizeable because they contain several modules, components and services. A micro framework, on the other hand, fits into a single code source file.As such, it’s used whenever minimum coding is required like small applications and REST-based apps. You can also use clone this project to download all the required plugins and datasets: git clone https://github.com/lauvindra/Online-Book-Store-Using-Flask.git 2. Objective  To create a book store web application using a microframeworks To enable the web application to Create,Read,Update,Delete Use Object-relational mapping(ORM) for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming technique.  3. Flask   Flask is a microframework, which means it is more focused on simplicity and less on functions. Microframeworks lack functionality but they can be extended with databases and templating engines. It is a lightweight modular framework and can be adapted to a variety of tasks.It has a number of useful features, such as an integrated development server and a quick debugger, Jinja2 template engine, support for secure cookies, the ability to connect any ORM. Jinja2 template engine is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.  3. SQLAlchemy   SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. Instead of hiding away SQL and object relational details behind a wall of automation, SQLAlchemy's overall approaches all processes are fully exposed within a series of composable, transparent tools. A relationally-oriented query system, exposing the full range of SQL's capabilities explicitly, including joins, subqueries, correlation, and most everything else, in terms of the object mode  4.Online Book Store These are the implementation of Flask together with a database using Flask SQLAlchemy.

417800683;SmartMouse;https://github.com/Lyrain02/SmartMouse;C++;2021-10-16T10:59:50Z;0;0;0;SmartMouse This is the class project for Innovation Practice. Its a simple implementation of a smartmouse built by Arduino and python. Arduino is used in the implementation of the smartmouse, and python is used to realize bluetooth communicaition and GUI control. For this project, you can use the smart mouse to control the cursor on the screen of computer. Besides, you can use it to control the movement of the drawing car built by Arduino Uno. why smartmouse? Tranditional mouse need a smooth and solid surface. But sometimes, when you want to use your computer and mouse on a sofa, it may be difficult for you to use the mouse, because the sofa is so soft and sometimes rough. Then you may need a smart mouse which can be used in the air, so that you can get rid of the dependence on the solid surface. Maybe sounds a little silly, but that's the originl intention why I conduct this project. This smart mouse is designed for non-solid surface, which means you can use it in the air. Implementation Hardware Smart Mouse  Arduino Nano, adxl345, hc-06 module, 3 button, 1 led, 1 resistence, wires and power. Drawing Car  Arduino Uno, Uno expansion board, L298N motor drive, 2 motors, 3D printing car materials, wires and power. In fact, the car is not designed by myself, and I just bought the materials online and assembled the car. This car is only used to show the control of the smart mouse. It's not the core of the design but an application. Software Python is so powerful that I use serial to realize Bluetooth communication between mouse and computer, and pyautogui to control the cursor movement of a computer screen.

Once the temperature ranges are selected a map is generated where four cities can be selected to travel between.  A directions map with weather information is made from the four cities selected. Approach Weather Database Random GPS coordinates are generated and citipy returns a nearest city.  This city is then passed to the OpenWeather API which returns weather conditions. Vacation Search By limiting cities according to the users desirable temperature ranges, a subset for vacation planning is offered. Vacation Itinerary After allowing the user to select a start, stop, and three waypoints, gmaps is leveraged with Google's API to generate directions maps.

However, MSE may not always be optimal, especially for a ranking problem. Some problems may benefit from custom loss functions. Is a ranking loss function optimal for a ranking problem? By building decision tree and AdaBoost models from scratch, it is possible to customize the pruning loss function used in the models. A simulation study found that Average Precision at k outperformed MSE for the decision tree model. While, MSE outperformed Average Precision at k for the AdaBoost model. Finally, the models were applied to professional golf data where the results aligned with the simulation study.

417837873;Credit_Risk_Analysis;https://github.com/jpmendeziii/Credit_Risk_Analysis;Jupyter Notebook;2021-10-16T13:34:18Z;1;1;0;Credit_Risk_Analysis Overview The purpose of this analysis is to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. Six different methods were utilized.    Naive Random Oversampling     SMOTE Oversampling     Cluster Centroid Undersampling     SMOTEENN Sampling     Balanced Random Forest Classifying     Easy Ensemble Classifying    Through each of these methods, the data was split into training and testing datasets. Accuracy scores, confusion matrices and classification reports were compiled in summary form. Deliverable 1 Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk  Random Oversampling  Accuracy Score: 67.4%   SMOTE Oversampling  Accuracy Score: 68.2%  Deliverable 2 Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk  Undersampling Analysis  Accuracy Score: 52.2%   SMOTEENN Analysis  Accuracy Score: 68.1%  Deliverable 3 Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk  Random Forest Analysis  Accuracy Score: 64.8%   Easy Ensemble Analysis  Accuracy Score: 92.3%  Summary This analysis tries to find the best model that can detect if a loan is high-risk. Because of that, we need to find a model that lets the least amount of high-risk loans pass through undetected. That correlating statistic for this is the recall rate for high-risk. Looking through the different models, the ones that scored the highest were:  Easy Ensemble Analysis (91%) SMOTEENN Analysis (76%) SMOTE Oversampling (70%)  While this is the most important statistic that is pulled from this analysis, another important statistic is recall rate for low-risk as it shows how many low-risk loans are flagged as high-risk. Looking through the different models, the ones that scored the highest were:  Random Forest Analysis (100%) Easy Ensemble Analysis (94%)  However, one looks at the accuracy score to get a picture of how well the model performs in general. The models with the highest accuracy scores were:  Easy Ensemble Analysis (92.3%) SMOTE Oversampling (68.2%) SMOTEENN Analysis (68.1%)  Therefore the model that is recommended by factoring multiple metrics is the Easy Ensemble Analysis.

They are struggling in terms of predicting the prices of the houses in a specific area they want to expand in. Hence they require an accurate predictive analysis so that their buying decisions doesn't turn out unreasonable. Understanding the requirement - As Machine learning engineers our first job is to understand the requirements properly. Exploring the business objectives . Getting an idea of what resources available and sharing what additional resources might be required for the project. These meeting are to be conducted along with stakeholders of the company. We also need to understand that what kind of solution is currently being implemented to address this issue. Understanding the Dataset - The Dataset shared with us need to be analysed in-depth to provide an acurate model. currently the data set we have consist of the following details - 1. Title: Boston Housing Data 2. Sources: (a) Origin:  This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. (b) Creator:  Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L.

In here our target variable is ' MEDV '  which is the house prices and it's a continious variable. So initially we'll use Linear Regression for training and later on , to improve accuracy we'll check if decision tree or random forest works better with our data. This model will be a supervised learning as we have labels of the data with us. As in this dataset we have data that is already present with us and no live streaming data "

Getting Started This can be used as a package with the Swift Package Manager or by linking the library with your program. Linking using swiftc Suppose you have the following program in a file named main.swift (Swift requires the main execution logic be in a file named main.swift instead of in a main function found in other languages i.e. C/C++, Go, or Java) that prints to standard output using this library. writeln(""Hello, World!"")

By using Extreme Value Statistics and assuming the validity of the LCDM cosmology, one can build a statistical model to predict the mass of the most massive galaxy cluster at a given redshift z. This code can be used to compute those predictions under the thin redshift bin hypothesis (dz <= 0.1). Sources : This library is based on the Fortran code developed by Pier-Stefano Corasaniti (LUTH) The following papers were also used for the development of this code :  Harrison & Coles, Testing Cosmology with Extreme Galaxy Clusters : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1184.pdf Tinker et al., Toward a halo mass function for precision cosmology: the limits of universality : https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2706.pdf Chongchitnan, On the Abundance of Extreme Voids : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07705.pdf Planck Collaboration, Planck 2018 results : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06209.pdf  Author : Thomas MAYNADIE

417968396;Google_Search_in_python3;https://github.com/viracall/Google_Search_in_python3;Python;2021-10-16T23:02:10Z;0;0;0;"Google_Search_in_python3 There are several different google search library for python out there. In this repo I use some of them to create a more easy to use and generic search function and download ability.   As google enhance it's search engine there will be permanent changes needed for scraping tool such as this one. It is therefore important to inform the developer if implementation does not work. Please let me know if you encounter problems with the implementation and I will hopefully be able to help. Purpose The reason I want to be able to preform searches through a search engine is to create large datasets for machine learning. Mainly I created this repo to make the google search calls easier to use, by setting alot of the default parameters. Both textual and images. I will probably reuse some code from this repo in future development. If no interest is shown to this repo it will probably be removed from github eventually, to merge it with a larger project. How to use Copy the ""Google_Search_Functions.py"" file into your project. Try running the test.py file. This file contains the following code: import Google_Search_Functions as google  google.search(""Cute Kittens"", type = ""image"", download = True, num = 10);  This program will download 10 images of ""Cute Kittens"" from google search into a folder called ""downloads"". See default values in Google_Search_Functions, there you can see several other interesting parameters. More Code Examples Search 10 websites: response = google.search(""Cute Kittens"");  Search and download 11 Swedish news: response = google.search(""Cute Kittens"", type = ""news"", num = 11, lang=""sv"", download = True);  Safe search 10 video: response = google.search(""Cute Kittens"", type = ""video"", Safe = ""true"");  Search and download 10 images with rights and output path: response = google.search(""Cute Kittens"", type = ""image"", Safe = ""true"", path = 'path', download = True, rights =""labeled-for-nocommercial-reuse"" );  Run on docker I have now added a docker container for running the implementation without an unnecessary installation process. Try it out by installing docker and run: docker-compose up  Edit the test.py file. About This implementation lets you download or get urls to websites for google searches. Depending on parameters you might get different return values. Check them out in the Google_Search_Functions file. The reason I use and depend on other libraries are to save time. However it is possible that I will recreate this repo in the future and then instead write from scratch to make a more clean solution. The solution would include a lot of scraping from google. In the library google-images-download some html scrape is used. See link below and check out the code if you plan to instead scrape and make your own implementation. My thoughts in the matter right now is, why reinvent the wheel? This implementation is good enough. Further development In the future it might be interesting to use other search engines such as bing, DuckDuckGo, Wiki.com, Twitter, CC Search, Gibiru, StartPage. I might choose to create my entire own implementation in the future if I for some reason don't like this solution. Screenshots Download 10 images of ""Cute kittens"":  Requirements In this python program we use the following imports: import google                   # Search links import google_images_download   # Search and download images  Install them by writing: pip install -r requirements.txt  Sources and References Information and examples of how to use:   google-image-download library https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download   googlesearch library https://python-googlesearch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/   Issues If you find any issues with this solution please leave an issue-ticket on the repository. Disclaimer These functions lets you download tons of data from Google. Please do not download or use any data that violates its copyright terms. Google is a search engine that merely indexes data and allows you to find them. It does NOT produce its own data and, as such, it doesn't own copyright on any of them.

You can pull these instructions directly into your repo by running this command: $ git pull old-origin master  If you don't have my repo's URL configured under the name old-origin, you can run these commands instead: $ git remote add eriks-origin git@gitlab.cs.usu.edu:erik.falor/cs1440-falor-erik-assn2 $ git pull eriks-origin master   Instructions Hints Rubric Installing the Text Tools  Overview Your last project was a great success! The customer was very pleased with their new TextTools and so impressed with the quality of your work that they have decided to contract you to finish the entire project for them. Your task is to analyze a large body of data and produce a report of the findings.  This program summarizes national employment data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2020.  The report consists of two sections, a summary across all industries and a summary across the software publishing industry.  I worked with the customer far enough to develop the format of the report.  It is your task to analyze a 493MB CSV file to pull out the data needed by the report. Objectives  Learn how to process a large body of data Using Python's built-in string operations Research programming documentation Reading, understanding, and following instructions Using advanced data structures (list, dictionary, set) Apply problem solving strategies  Divide the problem Reduce the problem Don't get frustrated   Exercise debugging techniques  Direct debugging with the IDE Indirect debugging Wolf-Fence debugging    Expected Behavior Each subfolder of data/ contains a file named output.txt. Your program's output for that data set should match that file exactly. Instructions for creating the testing data sets using the Text Tools from Assignment #1 are provided.

The last update to this file was: August 17, 2021 Reminders  Your code must be placed in the run.py file Your dependencies must be placed in the requirements.txt file Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly  Creating the Heroku app When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:  heroku/python heroku/nodejs  You must then create a Config Var called PORT. Set this to 8000 If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another Config Var called CREDS and paste the JSON into the value field. Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal. Constraints The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.  Happy coding!

Discutiremos a importância de uma boa documentação e testes. Abordaremos conceitos como integração com serviços externos, integração contínua e testes automatizados. Analisaremos cenários onde precisaremos de uma melhor performance e algumas técnicas para alcançar este objetivo como chamadas a funções assíncronas. Vamos tentar nos preparar para situações ruins que possam acontecer e garantir que nosso sistema será resiliente. Tópicos abordados  Integração com serviços externos Integração contínua Testes automatizados Invocação de processos assíncronos Circuit breaker Compartilhamento de memória  O que será desenvolvido? Será desenvolvido um sistema com objetivo de obter informações a respeito de pedidos. Os pedidos serão obtidos através de integração com o sistema de pedidos do Magalu. Vamos fazer o enriquecimento desta informação antes de sua exibição e também iremos prover alguns dados estatísticos sobre o pedido. Um pedido possui vários pacotes, cada um deles contendo itens. Este sistema deve seguir as seguintes regras:  Deve apresentar uma interface que possa ser consumida tanto por um website, quanto por um aplicativo para dispositivos móveis; Deve prover um endpoint que indique a saúde do sistema; Dado um pedido, retornar os seus itens; Os itens de um pedido devem conter um identificador (sku), uma descrição, uma imagem, uma referência e a quantidade; Exibir um relatório com o total de métodos de pagamento utilizados nos últimos 30 pedidos; Dado um pedido (vários itens), enriquecer a informação com as informações de gtin (global trade item number). Deve ser retornado também a marca, descrição e - identificação do produto; Como será consumido por terceiros deve apresentar boa documentação; O sistema deve estar preparado para receber novas funcionalidades, garantindo qualidade a cada entrega; O sistema deve apresentar testes.

General Information  Website: https://www.python.org Source code: https://github.com/python/cpython Issue tracker: https://bugs.python.org Documentation: https://docs.python.org Developer's Guide: https://docs.python.org/devguide/   Contributing to CPython For more complete instructions on contributing to CPython development, see the Developer Guide.  Using Python Installable Python kits, and information about using Python, are available at python.org.  Build Instructions On Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, and Cygwin: ./configure make make test sudo make install  This will install Python as python3. You can pass many options to the configure script; run ./configure --help to find out more.  On macOS and Cygwin, the executable is called python.exe; elsewhere it's just python. On macOS, if you have configured Python with --enable-framework, you should use make frameworkinstall to do the installation.  Note that this installs the Python executable in a place that is not normally on your PATH, you may want to set up a symlink in /usr/local/bin. On Windows, see PCbuild/readme.txt. If you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from there. For example: mkdir debug cd debug ../configure --with-pydebug make make test  (This will fail if you also built at the top-level directory.  You should do a make clean at the toplevel first.) To get an optimized build of Python, configure --enable-optimizations before you run make.  This sets the default make targets up to enable Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) and may be used to auto-enable Link Time Optimization (LTO) on some platforms.  For more details, see the sections below.  Profile Guided Optimization PGO takes advantage of recent versions of the GCC or Clang compilers.  If ran, make profile-opt will do several steps. First, the entire Python directory is cleaned of temporary files that may have resulted in a previous compilation. Then, an instrumented version of the interpreter is built, using suitable compiler flags for each flavour. Note that this is just an intermediary step and the binary resulted after this step is not good for real life workloads, as it has profiling instructions embedded inside. After this instrumented version of the interpreter is built, the Makefile will automatically run a training workload. This is necessary in order to profile the interpreter execution. Note also that any output, both stdout and stderr, that may appear at this step is suppressed. Finally, the last step is to rebuild the interpreter, using the information collected in the previous one. The end result will be a Python binary that is optimized and suitable for distribution or production installation.  Link Time Optimization Enabled via configure's --with-lto flag.  LTO takes advantage of the ability of recent compiler toolchains to optimize across the otherwise arbitrary .o file boundary when building final executables or shared libraries for additional performance gains.  What's New We have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the What's New in Python 3.6 document.  For a more detailed change log, read Misc/NEWS, but a full accounting of changes can only be gleaned from the commit history. If you want to install multiple versions of Python see the section below entitled ""Installing multiple versions"".  Documentation Documentation for Python 3.6 is online, updated daily. It can also be downloaded in many formats for faster access.  The documentation is downloadable in HTML, PDF, and reStructuredText formats; the latter version is primarily for documentation authors, translators, and people with special formatting requirements. For information about building Python's documentation, refer to Doc/README.rst.  Converting From Python 2.x to 3.x Significant backward incompatible changes were made for the release of Python 3.0, which may cause programs written for Python 2 to fail when run with Python 3.  For more information about porting your code from Python 2 to Python 3, see the Porting HOWTO.  Testing To test the interpreter, type make test in the top-level directory.  The test set produces some output.  You can generally ignore the messages about skipped tests due to optional features which can't be imported.  If a message is printed about a failed test or a traceback or core dump is produced, something is wrong. By default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk space and memory.  To enable these tests, run make testall. If any tests fail, you can re-run the failing test(s) in verbose mode: make test TESTOPTS=""-v test_that_failed""  If the failure persists and appears to be a problem with Python rather than your environment, you can file a bug report and include relevant output from that command to show the issue.  Installing multiple versions On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python using the same installation prefix (--prefix argument to the configure script) you must take care that your primary python executable is not overwritten by the installation of a different version.  All files and directories installed using make altinstall contain the major and minor version and can thus live side-by-side.  make install also creates ${prefix}/bin/python3 which refers to ${prefix}/bin/pythonX.Y.  If you intend to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which version (if any) is your ""primary"" version.  Install that version using make install.  Install all other versions using make altinstall. For example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 with 3.6 being the primary version, you would execute make install in your 3.6 build directory and make altinstall in the others.  Issue Tracker and Mailing List Bug reports are welcome!  You can use the issue tracker to report bugs, and/or submit pull requests on GitHub. You can also follow development discussion on the python-dev mailing list.  Proposals for enhancement If you have a proposal to change Python, you may want to send an email to the comp.lang.python or python-ideas mailing lists for initial feedback.  A Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) may be submitted if your idea gains ground. All current PEPs, as well as guidelines for submitting a new PEP, are listed at python.org/dev/peps/.

Entenda melhor analisando os exemplos à seguir: bin2dec(binary_digits='1234') >>> ValueError: Only binary digits (0 and 1) are allowed: ""1234"" entered No exemplo acima, vemos que a função lança uma exceção, o que de imediato quebraria o programa. Mas testar tudo digitado pelo usuário no seu próprio código seria meio verboso, por isso a função já testa e retorna exceções que o ajudam à informar seu usuário. Tratando exceções Usando o trecho de código abaixo, vamos exemplificar como a função lida com erros e o ajuda à tratá-los. from bin2dec import bin2dec   try:   bin_digit = str(input('bin: '))   print(bin2dec(binary_digits=bin_digit)) except Exception as e:   print(f'Sorry, something went wrong: {e}') Agora executando este módulo e inserindo bla bla na entrada, temos uma saída parecida com: >>> Sorry, something went wrong: Only binary digits (0 and 1) are allowed: ""blabla"" entered Sucesso Você viu que esta função pode ser útil quando queremos converter um conjunto de dígitos binários para a notaçao decimal de numeração. Fique à vontade para brincar com esta função, no entanto pesso que releia a licença. "

Overview of distribution probability    conjugate means it has relationship of conjugate distributions.  In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distributions p(θ | x) are in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution p(θ), the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function. Conjugate prior, wikipedia    Multi-Class means that Random Varivance are more than 2.   N Times means that we also consider prior probability P(X).   To learn more about probability, I recommend reading [pattern recognition and machine learning, Bishop 2006].   distribution probabilities and features  Uniform distribution(continuous), code  Uniform distribution has same probaility value on [a, b], easy probability.      Bernoulli distribution(discrete), code  Bernoulli distribution is not considered about prior probability P(X). Therefore, if we optimize to the maximum likelihood, we will be vulnerable to overfitting. We use binary cross entropy to classify binary classification. It has same form like taking a negative log of the bernoulli distribution.      Binomial distribution(discrete), code  Binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments. Binomial distribution is distribution considered prior probaility by specifying the number to be picked in advance.      Multi-Bernoulli distribution, Categorical distribution(discrete), code  Multi-bernoulli called categorical distribution, is a probability expanded more than 2. cross entopy has same form like taking a negative log of the Multi-Bernoulli distribution.      Multinomial distribution(discrete), code  The multinomial distribution has the same relationship with the categorical distribution as the relationship between Bernoull and Binomial.      Beta distribution(continuous), code  Beta distribution is conjugate to the binomial and Bernoulli distributions. Using conjucation, we can get the posterior distribution more easily using the prior distribution we know. Uniform distiribution is same when beta distribution met special case(alpha=1, beta=1).      Dirichlet distribution(continuous), code  Dirichlet distribution is conjugate to the MultiNomial distributions. If k=2, it will be Beta distribution.      Gamma distribution(continuous), code  Gamma distribution will be beta distribution, if Gamma(a,1) / Gamma(a,1) + Gamma(b,1) is same with Beta(a,b). The exponential distribution and chi-squared distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution.      Exponential distribution(continuous), code  Exponential distribution is special cases of the gamma distribution when alpha is 1.      Gaussian distribution(continuous), code  Gaussian distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution      Normal distribution(continuous), code  Normal distribution is standarzed Gaussian distribution, it has 0 mean and 1 std.      Chi-squared distribution(continuous), code  Chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom is the distribution of a sum of the squares of k independent standard normal random variables. Chi-square distribution is special case of Beta distribution      Student-t distribution(continuous), code  The t-distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, like the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, meaning that it is more prone to producing values that fall far from its mean.

Background Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: ""What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"" Now, we know what you may be thinking: ""Duh. It gets hotter..."" But, if pressed, how would you prove it?  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside the repository folder you just created, add new files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.   Push the above changes to GitHub.   Adding A .gitignore File We don't want the api_keys.py file containing the API key to be exposed to the public on GitHub, as this would mean anyone could copy and use our API key, possibly causing us to incur charges. When we type git status in the command line, we can see all the files we have created so far that are untracked. If we only wanted to add the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub we could type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. However, every time we want to add a new file or update current files to the repository, we have to add each file individually, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, we can add the files we don't want to track to the .gitignore file. Before we add our files to GitHub, let's add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file. Follow these steps:   Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.   Open the .gitignore file, and on the first line type the following:   # Adding config.py file. api_keys.py   While the .gitignore file is open, add the API_practice.ipynb and random_numbers.ipynb files and save the file.   In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should say the .gitignore file has been modified and the WeatherPy.ipynb file is untracked.   Use git add, git commit, and git push to commit the modifications to .gitignore and the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub.   On GitHub, the only new file you should see is the WeatherPy.ipynb file. Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing. The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each pair of plots, take the time to explain what the linear regression is modeling. For example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have. Your final notebook must:  Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name. Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.  Part II - VacationPy Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.   Note: Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform Billing and Manage your cost of use for more information.   Note: if you having trouble displaying the maps, try running jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and retry.   To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:   Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.    Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:   A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.   Wind speed less than 10 mph.   Zero cloudiness.   Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.   Note: Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.     Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.   Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.    As final considerations:  You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook. You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries. For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission. You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels. For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.  Hints and Considerations   The city data you generate is based on random coordinates as well as different query times. As such, your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.   If you'd like a refresher on the geographic coordinate system, this site has great information.   Next, spend the requisite time necessary to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should be aiming to have a crystal clear understanding of your intended outcome.   A starter code for Citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works: citipy Python library. Before you try to incorporate the library into your analysis, start by creating simple test cases outside your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Too often, when introduced to a new library, students get bogged down by the most minor of errors -- spending hours investigating their entire code -- when, in fact, a simple and focused test would have shown their basic utilization of the library was wrong from the start. Don't let this be you!   Part of our expectation in this challenge is that you will use critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending the tools we are. What is Citipy for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?   In building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you getting coverage of the full gamut of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you simply choosing 500 cities concentrated in one region of the world? Even if you were a geographic genius, simply rattling 500 cities based on your human selection would create a biased dataset. Be thinking of how you should counter this. (Hint: Consider the full range of latitudes).   Once you have computed the linear regression for one chart, the process will be similar for all others. As a bonus, try to create a function that will create these charts based on different parameters.   Remember that each coordinate will trigger a separate call to the Google API. If you're creating your own criteria to plan your vacation, try to reduce the results in your DataFrame to 10 or fewer cities.   Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file.   Lastly, remember -- this is a challenging activity. Push yourself! If you complete this task, then you can safely say that you've gained a strong mastery of the core foundations of data analytics and it will only go better from here. Good luck!

The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. InsertionSort.py Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. SelectionSort.py selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.

Часть 2 (с опытом работы) 50+ ответов на вопросовы с собеседований по Python 80 практических вопросов по Python для собеседования Разные задачи на Python и решение к ним  1. Виды типизации  Статическая - типизация, при которой переменная связывается с типом в момент объявления, и тип не может быть изменён позже, динамическая - типизация, при которой тип переменной задается в момент присваивания значения, а не в момент объявления, и т.о. может быть изменен позже.  пример статической типизации (С++): int x = 5; x = ""abc"";  // здесь C++ компилятор будет ругаться  или, что то же самое: int x; x = 5; x = ""abc""; // здесь C++ компилятор будет ругаться  пример динамической типизации (Python): x = 5 x = ""a""  # здесь интерпретатор не ругается, так как типизация динамическая   Строгая - отсутствие автоматических кастов в другой тип (неявных преборазований). Нестрогая - наличие таковых.  пример строгой типизации (Python): a = [5, 6] print("","".join(a))  # здесь интерпретатор ругается, так как join() ожидает список строк на входе  пример нестрогой типизации (Javascript): let a = ""hello""; let b = 100; let c = a + b; console.log(c);  // ""hello100""   Явная - указываем типы везде руками. Неявная - компилятор/интерпретатор занимается этим сам.  пример явной типизации (C++): int x = 5; y = 6;  // здесь компилятор будет ругаться  пример неявной типизации (Python): a = 1  Важно: наиболее рационально и оптимально память используется в случае строгой статической типизации. <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ 2.

Строки в python Cтрока – это упорядоченная последовательность символов, которая предназначена для хранения информации в виде простого текста. В Python3 строка по умолчнанию имеет кодировку Unicode, что избавляет от проблем работы и отображения символов кирилицы и прочих экзотических кодировок. Строка это неизменяемый тип данных, т.е. если нужно добавить символов в существующую строку, придется создать новую строку, с новым адресом в памяти: a = ""hello"" id(a) # 2044344987401 a = ""hello world"" id(a) # 2044334957804  к оглавлению ⬆️ 6. Списки (lists) и кортежи (tuples) в python Списки Python схожи с массивами в других языках. Кортеж похож на список, но вы создаете его с круглыми скобками, вместо квадратных. Вы также можете использовать встроенный инструмент для создания кортежей. Разница между списками и кортежами в том, что кортеж неизменяем, в то время как список изменяем. Т.е. в список можно добавить элемент и его адрес в памяти не изменится, а если нужно добавить элемент в кортеж, то нужно создать новый кортеж, и у него уже будет новый адрес в памяти: # список a = [1,2] id(a) # 2044364987904 a.append(3) id(a) # 2044364987904  # кортеж a = (1,2) id(a) # 2044370285184 a = (1,2,3) id(a) # 2044369999872  Важно: кортеж занимает меньше места в памяти чем список, и поэтому всегда, когда массив объектов заведомо неизменяем, рекомендуется использовать кортежи, вместо списков. к оглавлению ⬆️ 7. Cловарь в python Словари в Python - коллекции произвольных объектов с доступом по ключу. Начиная с Python3.6 словарь dict() упорядочен, т.е. при переборе имеющегося словаря, элементы возвращаются в том порядке, в котором они были добавлены в словарь при его наполнении. До Python3.6 приходилось использовать объект OrderedDict(), чтобы иметь упорядоченную коллекцию, с доступам к элементам по ключам. Словарь это изменяемый тип данных. к оглавлению ⬆️ 8.

Как создать гит репозиторий локально git init  к оглавлению ⬆️ 11. Что такое git push Отправка всех неотправленных локальных коммитов на удалённый сервер репозитория. к оглавлению ⬆️ 12. Что делает git commit Фиксирует изменения локальных файлов в таймлайне репозитория. Другими словами делает ""моментальный снимок"" репозитория в данный момент времени, который и является версией. к оглавлению ⬆️ 13. Git merge и rebase git merge - принимает содержимое ветки источника и объединяет их с целевой веткой. В этом процессе изменяется только целевая ветка. История исходных веток остается неизменной. git rebase — еще один способ перенести изменения из одной ветки в другую. Rebase сжимает все изменения в один «патч». Затем он интегрирует патч в целевую ветку. В отличие от слияния, перемещение перезаписывает историю, потому что она передает завершенную работу из одной ветки в другую. В процессе устраняется нежелательная история. к оглавлению ⬆️ 14. Что такое виртуальное окружение Виртуальное окружение (virtualenv) — это инструмент для создания отдельного пространства для проекта с его зависимостями и библиотеками в директории проекта. к оглавлению ⬆️ 15. Как установить виртуальное окружение pip install virtualenv python -m venv namevenv  к оглавлению ⬆️ 16. Виды форматирования строк  Форматирование f-строками. Форматирование методом str.format(). Форматирование оператором '%'.  к оглавлению ⬆️ 17. Cрезы или слайсы в python item[START:STOP:STEP]  Функция Python slice() возвращает нарезанный объект из набора индексов ввода, указанного пользователем в соответствии с переданными ему аргументами. Объект должен быть iterable. к оглавлению ⬆️ 18. Что такое итерация Переход к следующему объекту в коллекции, например список, кортеж и т.д. Сам по себе объект коллекции должен быть iterable. к оглавлению ⬆️ 19. Какие циклы есть в python while и for. к оглавлению ⬆️ 20. Чем отличается while от for For используется только тогда, когда необходимо совершить перебор элементов заранее известное число раз. Цикл while также используется для повторения частей кода, но вместо зацикливания на n количество раз, он выполняет работу до тех пор, пока не достигнет определенного условия. Выйти из цикла в любой момент можно используя ключевое слово break, а перейти на следующую итерацию цикла можно используя слово continue. к оглавлению ⬆️ 21. Каким образом реализовано ветвление в python if-elif-else к оглавлению ⬆️ 22. Как запросить у пользователя ввод Для получения информации с клавиатуры в Python есть функция input(). к оглавлению ⬆️ 23. Преобразование типов  Преобразование типов - это преобразование объекта из одного типа данных в другой тип данных. Неявное преобразование типов автоматически выполняется интерпретатором Python. Python позволяет избежать потери данных в неявном преобразовании типов. Явное преобразование типов также называется приведением типов, типы данных объекта преобразуются с использованием предопределенной функции. При приведении типов может произойти потеря данных, поскольку мы приводим объект к определенному типу данных.  к оглавлению ⬆️ 24. Что такое аннотация типов В простейшем случае аннотация содержит непосредственно ожидаемый тип. Аннотации для переменных пишут через двоеточие после идентификатора. После этого может идти инициализация значения. Например price: int = 5 Параметры функции аннотируются так же как переменные, а возвращаемое значение указывается после стрелки -> и до завершающего двоеточия. Например def indent_right(s: str, width: int) -> str:. Важно: аннотация типов не есть то же самое, что статическая типизация. к оглавлению ⬆️ 25. Строка это последовательность или нет Да. к оглавлению ⬆️ 26. Что такое PEP PEP - Python Enhancement Proposals - база всех предложений как улучшить Python и что изменить. Например PEP8 - это общепринятое руководство по написанию кода на Python. к оглавлению ⬆️ 27. Что такое фунция range Функция range() возвращает объект с интерфейсом итератора, выдающий элементы из диапазона, определяемого аргументами функции range(старт, стоп, шаг), при этом не храня все элементы в памяти. к оглавлению ⬆️ 28. Что делает enumerate Если начальное значение счётчика enumerate() не передаётся — оно, по умолчанию, устанавливается в 0. Функция создаёт объект, генерирующий кортежи, состоящие из индекса элемента и самого этого элемента. к оглавлению ⬆️ 29. Какие методы списков  list.append(x) Добавляет элемент в конец списка list.extend(L) Расширяет список list, добавляя в конец все элементы списка L list.insert(i, x)	Вставляет на i-ый элемент значение x list.remove(x) Удаляет первый элемент в списке, имеющий значение x. ValueError, если такого элемента не существует list.pop([i])	Удаляет i-ый элемент и возвращает его. Если индекс не указан, удаляется последний элемент list.index(x, [start [, end]])	Возвращает положение первого элемента со значением x (при этом поиск ведется от start до end) list.count(x)	Возвращает количество элементов со значением x list.sort([key=функция])	Сортирует список на основе функции list.reverse() Разворачивает список list.copy()	Поверхностная копия списка list.clear() Очищает список  к оглавлению ⬆️ 30. Что в python не является объектом В python всё является объектом, кроме ключевых слов: in, is, if, while, и т.д. к оглавлению ⬆️ 31. Название переменных Имя переменной может состоять только из цифр, букв и знаков подчеркивания. Имя переменной может начинаться только с буквы или с нижнего подчеркивания. Никаких чисел в начале имени переменной быть не должно.  Имя переменной не может содержать ключевые слова (зарезервированные) языка Python. Принято разделять слова нижним подчеркиванием (snake case). к оглавлению ⬆️ 32. Что такое литералы Литерал в Python – это простейший способ создания объектов. Если в тексте программы встречается литерал, то для этого литерала создается отдельный объект некоторого типа, соответствующего содержанию литерала: ""Hello""  # строковый литерал 1123     # целочисленный литерал [1,2]    # списковый литерал  к оглавлению ⬆️ 33. Можно ли число сделать строкой Чтобы конвертировать число в строку, используйте встроенную функцию str(). к оглавлению ⬆️ 34. Что делает метод split() Разбивает строку на части, используя специальный разделитель, и возвращает эти части в виде списка str.split([разделитель [, maxsplit]]). к оглавлению ⬆️ 35. Что делает метод join() Метод ""str"".join([""Hello"", ""world""]) возвращает строку, которая является конкатенацией (объединением) всех элементов строк итерируемого объекта iterable. В итоговой строке элементы объединяются между собой при помощи строки-разделителя str. Элементы итерируемого объекта должны быть строками (ну или как минимум иметь реализованный магический метод __str__()). к оглавлению ⬆️ 36. Как импортировать модуль Используя ключевое слово “import”, например import random Использование псевдонимов — as. Некоторые модули имеют длинное и неудобное название. Для удобства и сокращения количества кода программист может заменить его на своё. Для импорта конкретных объектов используют конструкцию from ... import .... к оглавлению ⬆️ 37. Как импортировать все содержимое модуля from module_name import * import module_name  к оглавлению ⬆️ 38. Сколько пар ключ значение может быть в словаре Ограничено объемом оперативной памяти. к оглавлению ⬆️ 39. Какой тип данных может быть значением в словаре Ключом может являться в принципе любой неизменяемый тип данных. к оглавлению ⬆️ 40. Как узнать id элемента Функция id() возвращает уникальный идентификатор для указанного объекта. По сути этот идентификатор однозначно опредедяет адрес объекта в памяти интерпретатора. к оглавлению ⬆️ 41. Как узнать версию python В консоли прописать python --version к оглавлению ⬆️ 42. Отличия второго python от 3 Огромное количество отличий. Самые значимые/ключевые:  строки в Python3 по умолчанию в кодировке Unicode в Python3 теперь range вместо xrange в словарях в Python3 теперь нет некоторых методов в Python3 появилась возможность распаковывать переменных через оператор * -....  Подробнее здесь. к оглавлению ⬆️ 43. Как прервать выполнение цикла Оператор break досрочно прерывает цикл. к оглавлению ⬆️ 44. Что означает continue Оператор continue начинает следующий проход цикла, минуя оставшееся тело цикла (for или while). к оглавлению ⬆️ 45. Что будет если сравнить 5 и 5.0 True к оглавлению ⬆️ 46. Что быстрее python или c++ C++ к оглавлению ⬆️ 47. Что такое байт код Python - интерпретируемый язык программирования. Он не конвертирует свой код в машинный, который понимает железо (в отличие от С и С++). Процесс такой вот конвертации называется компилляцией. Вместо этого, Python-интерпретатор, а точнее говоря его стандартная реализация CPython, переводит код программы в байт-код, который запускается на виртуальной машине Python (PVM). Есть реализация интерпретатора Python, которая работает через JIT (just in time) компилляцию - Pypy. к оглавлению ⬆️ 48. Как избежать конфликтов при импорте файлов  Называть свои модули так, чтобы имена не совпадали с именами сторонних/стандартных библиотек, которые также используются в коде Ипользовать as при импорте, чтобы заменять названия импортируемых модулей  к оглавлению ⬆️ 49. Что означает %s %d %s Строка %d Десятичное число. к оглавлению ⬆️ 50. Что такое класс Класс — тип, описывающий устройство объектов. Другими словами, это описание сущности, у которой есть определенный набор свойств и методов. к оглавлению ⬆️ 51. Что такое наследование Возможность одному классу выступать в качестве наследника для другого, перенимая тем самым его свойства и методы. Ключевой момент наследования - это то, что класс наследник может не только использовать методы и свойства родительского класса, но и переопределить их, а также добавить новые свойства и методы. к оглавлению ⬆️ 52. Что такое инкапсуляция Ограничение доступа к составляющим объект компонентам (методам и свойствам). Инкапсуляция делает некоторые из компонент доступными только внутри класса. к оглавлению ⬆️ 53. Что такое полиморфизм Разное поведение одного и того же метода в разных классах. к оглавлению ⬆️ 54. Сколько может быть родителей и наследников у класса Неограниченное количество. к оглавлению ⬆️ 55. Что такое перегрузка операторов Один из способов реализации полиморфизма, заключающийся в возможности одновременного существования в одной области видимости нескольких различных вариантов применения оператора, имеющих одно и то же имя, но различающихся типами параметров, к которым они применяются. Перегрузка операторов не поддерживается в Python. Пример из C++, где поддерживается перегрузка операторов: float getArea(float a, float b) // функция, вычисляющая площадь прямоугольника с длиной a и высотой b {   return a * b; }  float getArea(float r) // функция, вычисляющая площадь круга с радиусом r {   return pi * r * r; }  float S1 = getArea(5.0, 6.0); // 30 float S3 = getArea(5.0); // 78.5  к оглавлению ⬆️ 56. Магические методы Это специальные методы в python, обрамленные двумя нижними подчеркиваниями  Инициализация объекта: __init__ Строковые представления: __repr__ , __str__ Итерация: __iter__ , __next__ и другие  к оглавлению ⬆️ 57. Модификаторы доступа Есть три типа модификаторов доступов в Python ООП:  публичный public приватный __private защищенный _protected  Важно: в Python нету жесткой инкапсуляции, т.е. даже к приватному методу можно получить доступ снаружи класса. Инкапсуляция в Python это больше договорянность между разработчиками, чем жесткое сокрытие, как например в C++ или Java. к оглавлению ⬆️ 58. Генераторы Это функция, которая будучи вызванной в функции next() возвращает следующий объект согласно алгоритму ее работы. Вместо ключевого слова return в генераторе используется yield. Главное отличие yield от return это то, что yield, после возврата объекта, сохраняет стек генератора, так что при следующем вызове функции next() от генератора, исполнение кода генератора продолжится с того момента, где yield вернул объект в прошлый раз. к оглавлению ⬆️ 59. Как пишутся комментарии в python С помощью символа #. Так же есть такое понятие как docstring задать его можно с помощью тройных кавычек. к оглавлению ⬆️ 60. Как можно обратить (reverse) порядок элементов в списке С помощью среза [::-1] или встроенной функции reversed(). к оглавлению ⬆️ 61. Если мы не поставим двоеточие в конце строки для цикла ""do-while"", он все равно сработает? В python такой цикл не реализован. Это вопрос из тех, которые с подвохом, когда упоминают элементы других языков. к оглавлению ⬆️ 62. Как убрать из списка дубликат элемента Для этого можно конвертировать список во множество set(). к оглавлению ⬆️ 63. Расскажите про арифметические операторы //, %, и **  Оператор // выполняет целочисленное деление и возвращает целую часть числа, полученного в результате операции:  7 // 2  = 3   Оператор ** возводит в степень:  2**10 = 1024   Оператор % возвращает результат деления по модулю, то есть остаток после деления:  13 % 7 = 6  к оглавлению ⬆️ 64. Как посчитать длину строки (string) Для этого вызываем функцию len(). к оглавлению ⬆️ 65. Расскажите про генераторы списков (list comprehension) Генераторы позволяют создавать списки с помощью одной строки кода >>> [i for i in range(1, 11, 2)] [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]   к оглавлению ⬆️ 66. Что такое HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol — «протокол передачи гипертекста». По умолчанию использует для работы TCP порт 80. к оглавлению ⬆️ 67. Что такое json, xml JSON - текстовый формат обмена данными, основанный на JavaScript - JavaScript Object Notation. XML - в переводе с англ eXtensible Markup Language — расширяемый язык разметки. Используется для хранения и передачи данных. к оглавлению ⬆️ 68. Чем отличается HTML и XML Разница: HTML - это язык разметки, который используется для разработки веб-страниц. Его основная цель - отображение данных с акцентом на их внешний вид. XML - это язык разметки, основной целью которого является транспортировка и хранение данных. к оглавлению ⬆️ 69. Что такое CRUD Терамин обозначающий четыре базовые функции: создание (create), чтение (read), редактирование (update) и удаление (delete). Как правило термин ""CRUD"" употребляется в контексте работы с хранилищем данных. к оглавлению ⬆️ 70. Какой паттерн программирования реализует Django Фреймворк Django реализует архитектурный паттерн Model-View-Template. В DRF Request-Process-Response. к оглавлению ⬆️ 71. На каком этапе в приложении Django происходит запрос к базе данных QuerySet может быть создан, отфильтрован, ограничен и использован фактически без выполнения запросов к базе данных. База данных не будет затронута, пока вы не спровоцируете выполнение QuerySet. к оглавлению ⬆️ 72. Какой результат будет Post.objects.all() и какого типа вернет Объект класса QuerySet. к оглавлению ⬆️ 73. Что такое SQL SQL или Structured Query Language (язык структурированных запросов) — язык программирования, предназначенный для управления данными в СУБД. к оглавлению ⬆️ 74. Каким запросом я могу достать все данные из таблицы SELECT * FROM nametable  к оглавлению ⬆️ 75. Что такое многие-ко-многим Связь многие ко многим описывает ситуацию, когда объект первой модели может одновременно ассоциироваться с несколькими объектами второй модели. И наоборот, один объект второй модели может также одновременно быть ассоциирован с несколькими объектами первой модели. Например, один студент может посещать несколько курсов, а один курс могут посещать несколько студентов. к оглавлению ⬆️ 76. Как реализуется М2М в SQL Связь многие ко многим подразумевает, что записи в одной таблице могут иметь множество ссылок на другую таблицу и наоборот. Когда есть такой тип связи нужно создавать дополнительную таблицу, которая сведет связь многие ко многим до связи один ко многим. к оглавлению ⬆️ 77. Что такое JOIN и какой он может быть  INNER JOIN (CROSS JOIN) - внутреннее (перекрёстное) объединение. LEFT JOIN - левостороннее внешнее объединение. RIGHT JOIN - правостороннее внешнее объединение. FULL OUTER JOIN (FULL JOIN) - полное объединение  к оглавлению ⬆️ 78. Что такое View Views отвечают за обработку и передачу данных и могут реализовывать одну или несколько функций. В Django используются два вида представлений:  Представления-функции (view functions), Представления-классы (class based views).  к оглавлению ⬆️ 79. Что такое миксины Mixin представляет собой набор свойств и методов, которые могут быть использованы в различных классах, которые не приходят из базового класса. к оглавлению ⬆️ 80. Звёздный синтаксис    и ** для передачи аргументов в функцию;     и **   для сбора переданных в функцию аргументов;   ** для принятия только именованных аргументов;   при распаковке кортежей;     для распаковки итерируемых объектов в список/кортеж;   ** для распаковки словарей в другие словари.  к оглавлению ⬆️ 81. Два способа создания класса Класс type() с тремя аргументами вернет объект нового типа. Это по сути динамическая форма инструкции class, ее еще называют метакласс. type(class_name, super_classes, attributes_dict) к оглавлению ⬆️ 82. Чем файл .pyc отличается от .py .pyc содержат скомпилированный байт-код исходных файлов Python к оглавлению ⬆️ 83. Что делает python объектно-ориентированым Он следует парадигме объектно-ориентированного программирования, которая построена вокруг классов (classes) и их экземпляров (instances). Это позволяет реализовать следующие функции:  сокрытие внутренней структуры данных абстракция наследование полиморфизм (способность выбирать правильный метод в зависимости от типа данных) ограничение доступа к данным.  к оглавлению ⬆️ 84. Как производится отладка программы на Python Использовать IDE с поддержкой дебага либо использовать модуль pdb import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  к оглавлению ⬆️ 85. Что такое GIL Глобальная блокировка интерпретатора CPython. Это механизм, который не позволяет нескольким потокам выполнить один и тот же байткод. Другими словами, благодаря GIL, в каждый момент времени в контексте одного процесса Python исполняется только один поток (Thread), все остальные ждут своей очереди на исполнение. Именно поэтому многопоточность не ускоряет обработку данных в разных потоках, так как по факту все обрабатывается последовательно. к оглавлению ⬆️ 86. Статусы ответов HTTP Коды сгруппированы в 5 классов:  Информационные 100 - 199 Успешные 200 - 299 Перенаправления 300 - 399 Клиентские ошибки 400 - 499 Серверные ошибки 500 – 599  Подробнее https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/HTTP/Status к оглавлению ⬆️ 87. Что такое Django Middleware Django Middleware (middleware в переводе ""промежуточный слой"") – это промежуточный слой между запросом (request) и ответом (response). В Django по умолчанию содержатся наиболее важные и нужные middleware. Например, AuthenticationMiddleware, ассоциирует пользователей с запросами с помощью сессий. Можно написать свой middleware: например хорошим вариантом может быть middleware для отлавливания и логгирования всех тех исключений которые не были отловлены на более низких уровнях. к оглавлению ⬆️ 88. Как вставить объект чтобы он оказался под определенным индексом? Сначала создадим список: >>> a=[1, 2, 4]  Затем используем метод insert(). В нем первым аргументом будет индекс, под которым вставляется объект, а вторым — значение объекта: >>> a.insert(2,3) >>> a [1, 2, 3, 4]  к оглавлению ⬆️ 89. Что нужно сделать, чтобы функция возвращала значение? Использовать оператор return или yield к оглавлению ⬆️ 90. Что если в функции не будет return, будет ли она что-то возвращать? Функция может и не заканчиваться инструкцией return, при этом функция вернет значение None <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ к оглавлению ⬆️        origin/main        91. Напишите в одну строку как можно получить самую позднюю по коду букву в строке Строковый метод  max() будет сравнивать значение ASCII каждого символа в строке и  возвращает максимальный алфавитный символ. >>> str = ""Wow! This is string!"" >>> max(str) 'w'  <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ к оглавлению ⬆️        origin/main        92. Как конвертировать список в строку? Мы могли бы использовать метод str.join() для преобразования списка, который имеет элементы типа данных str в строку. Например, >>> a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""] >>> """".join(a) 'abc'  Метод join объединяет любое количество строк, строка, метод которой вызывается, вставляется между каждой заданной строкой. Как показано в примере, между элементами списка вставляется строка """", пустая строка. Метод join требует в качестве заданных параметров тип данных str. Поэтому, если вы попытаетесь присоединиться к списку типов int, вы получите TypeError. Перед соединением тип int должен быть преобразован в тип str. >>> a = [1,2,3] >>> """".join([str(_) for _ in a]) ""123""  или при помощи функции map: >>> a = [1,2,3] >>> """".join(map(str, a)) '123'  <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ к оглавлению ⬆️        origin/main        93. Принципы SOLID S – Single Responsibility (Принцип единственной ответственности) Каждый класс должен отвечать только за одну операцию. O — Open-Closed (Принцип открытости-закрытости) Классы должны  быть  открыты для расширения, но закрыты для модификации. L — Liskov Substitution (Принцип подстановки Барбары Лисков) Если П является подтипом Т, то любые объекты типа Т, присутствующие в программе, могут заменяться объектами типа П без негативных последствий для функциональности программы. I — Interface Segregation (Принцип разделения интерфейсов) Не следует ставить клиент в зависимость от методов, которые он не использует. D — Dependency Inversion (Принцип инверсии зависимостей) Модули верхнего уровня не должны зависеть от модулей нижнего уровня. И те, и другие должны зависеть от абстракций. Абстракции не должны зависеть от деталей. Детали должны зависеть от абстракций. <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ к оглавлению ⬆️        origin/main        94. SQL JOIN INNER	JOIN		Возвращает записи которые имеют соответствие в обеих таблицах  OUTER	LEFT JOIN	Возвращает все записи из левой таблицы + записи которые имеют соответствие из правой  OUTER	RIGHT JOIN	Возвращает все записи из правой таблицы + записи которые имеют соответствие из левой  OUTER	FULL JOIN	Возвращает все записи из обеих таблиц  <<<<<<< HEAD к оглавлению ⬆️ к оглавлению ⬆️        origin/main        95. SQL оператор HAVING SQL оператор HAVING используется в сочетании с оператором GROUP BY, чтобы ограничить группы возвращаемых строк только теми, чьё условие TRUE. 96. Метаклассы в Python Метакласс это «штука», которая создаёт классы. Мы создаём класс для того, чтобы создавать объекты, так? А классы являются объектами. Метакласс это то, что создаёт эти самые объекты. Они являются классами классов, можно представить это себе следующим образом:   MyClass = MetaClass()   MyObject = MyClass()  Мы уже видели, что type позволяет делать что-то в таком духе: MyClass = type('MyClass', (), {}) Это потому что функция type на самом деле является метаклассом. type это метакласс, который Питон внутренне использует для создания всех классов. 97. Множественное наследование class Class1:         # Базовый класс для класса Class2     def f_func1(self):         print ""Метод f_func1() класса Class1""   class Class2(Class1): # Класс Class2 наследует класс Class1     def f_func2(self):         print ""Метод f_func2() класса Class2""   class Class3(Class1): # Класс Class3 наследует класс Class1     def f_func1(self):         print ""Метод f_func1() класса Class3""     def f_func2(self):         print ""Метод f_func2() класса Class3""     def f_func3(self):         print ""Метод f_func3() класса Class3""     def f_func4(self):         print ""Метод f_func4() класса Class3""   class Class4(Class2, Class3): # Множественное наследование     def f_func4(self):         print ""Метод f_func4() класса Class4""   c1 = Class4()             # Создаем экземпляр класса Class4 c1.f_func1()              # Выведет: Метод f_func1() класса Class1 c1.f_func2()              # Выведет: Метод f_func2() класса Class2 c1.f_func3()              # Выведет: Метод f_func3() класса Class3 c1.f_func4()              # Выведет: Метод f_func4() класса Class4  98.

Catwiki was originally written for Python 2.8. This version (catwiki_p3) is Catwiki for Python 3.5 and later. Features  Stores articles as text files, so they are easy to back up and manipulate. Even if the wiki software goes down, you can still get at your notes. Uses an enhanced version of the the Markdown markup language. Allows multiple wikis per installation, each one in its own directory. Allows subdirectories. You can navigate through the directories using the web interface. If the directory includes image files, the web page shows thumbnails of them. You can add Font Awesome icons in your wiki pages.  Technology Used CatWiki is written in Python and uses the Flask lightweight web framework. Screenshots Here are some screenshots of CatWiki in action.

If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out HELP.md. If you get stuck on the exercise, check out HINTS.md, but try and solve it without using those first :) Introduction Python is a dynamic and strongly typed object-oriented programming language. It employs both duck typing and gradual typing, via type hints. Programming across paradigms is fully supported -- but internally, everything in Python is an object. Python puts a strong emphasis on code readability and (similar to Haskell) uses significant indentation for function, method, and class definitions. The Zen of Python (PEP 20) and What is Pythonic? lay out additional philosophies. Objects are assigned to names via the assignment operator, =. Variables are written in snake_case, and constants usually in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. A name (variable or constant) is not itself typed, and can be attached or re-attached to different objects over its lifetime. For extended naming conventions and advice, see PEP 8. >>> my_first_variable = 1 >>> my_first_variable = ""Last one, I promise"" >>> print(my_first_variable) ... ""Last one, I promise"" Constants are typically defined on a module or global level, and although they can be changed, they are intended to be named only once. Their SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE is a message to other developers that the assignment should not be altered: # All caps signal that this is intended as a constant. MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = 16  # Re-assignment will be allowed by the compiler & interpreter, # but this is VERY strongly discouraged. # Please don't do: MY_FIRST_CONSTANT = ""Some other value"" The keyword def begins a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and a parenthesized list of zero or more formal parameters. Parameters can be of several different varieties, and can even vary in length. The def line is terminated with a colon. Statements for the body of the function begin on the line following def and must be indented in a block. There is no strict indentation amount (either space OR [tab] characters are acceptable), but indentation must be consistent for all indented statements. Functions explicitly return a value or object via the return keyword. # Function definition on first line. def add_two_numbers(number_one, number_two):   return number_one + number_two  # Returns the sum of the numbers, and is indented by 2 spaces.  >>> add_two_numbers(3, 4) 7 Functions that do not have an explicit return expression will return None. # This function will return None. def add_two_numbers(number_one, number_two):   result = number_one + number_two  >>> print(add_two_numbers(5, 7)) None Inconsistent indentation will raise an error: # The return statement line does not match the first line indent. >>> def add_three_numbers_misformatted(number_one, number_two, number_three): ...     result = number_one + number_two + number_three   # Indented by 4 spaces. ...    return result     #this was only indented by 3 spaces   File ""<stdin>"", line 3     return result                 ^ IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level Functions are called using their name followed by (). The number of arguments passed in the parentheses must match the number of parameters in the original function definition unless default arguments have been used: >>> def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):         """"""Raise a number to an arbitrary power.                  :param number_one: int the base number.         :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.         :return: int - number raised to power of second number                  Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.         """"""                  return number_one ** number_two ...  >>> number_to_the_power_of(3,3) 27 A mis-match between parameters and arguments will raise an error: >>> number_to_the_power_of(4,) ... Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> TypeError: number_to_the_power_of() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number_two' Adding a default value for a parameter can defend against such errors: >>> def number_to_the_power_of_default(number_one, number_two=2):         """"""Raise a number to an arbitrary power.                  :param number_one: int the base number.         :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.         :return: int - number raised to power of second number                  Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.         """"""          return number_one ** number_two  ... >>> number_to_the_power_of_default(4) 16 Methods bound to class names are invoked via dot notation (.), as are functions, constants, or global names imported as part of a module.: import string  # This is a constant provided by the *string* module. >>> print(string.ascii_lowercase) ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""  # This is a method call of the str *class*. >>> start_text = ""my silly sentence for examples."" >>> str.upper(start_text) ""MY SILLY SENTENCE FOR EXAMPLES.""  # This is a method call of an *instance* of the str *class*. >>> start_text.upper() ""MY SILLY SENTENCE FOR EXAMPLES."" Comments in Python start with a # that is not part of a string, and end at line termination. Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not support multi-line comment marks. Each line of a comment block must start with the # character. Comments are ignored by the interpreter: # This is a single line comment.  x = ""foo""  # This is an in-line comment.  # This is a multi-line # comment block over multiple lines -- # these should be used sparingly. The first statement of a function body can optionally be a docstring, which concisely summarizes the function or object's purpose. Docstrings are read by automated documentation tools and are returned by calling .__doc__ on the function, method, or class name. They can also function as lightweight unit tests, which will be covered in a later exercise. They are recommended for programs of any size where documentation is needed, and their conventions are laid out in PEP257: # An example on a user-defined function. >>> def number_to_the_power_of(number_one, number_two):         """"""Raise a number to an arbitrary power.                  :param number_one: int the base number.         :param number_two: int the power to raise the base number to.         :return: int - number raised to power of second number                  Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.         """"""          return number_one ** number_two ...  >>> print(number_to_the_power_of.__doc__) Returns float or int.         Takes number_one and raises it to the power of number_two, returning the result.  # __doc__() for the built-in type: str. >>> print(str.__doc__) str(object='') -> str str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler. Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined) or repr(object). encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding(). errors defaults to 'strict'. Instructions You're going to write some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook. You have five tasks, all related to cooking your recipe. 1. Define expected bake time in minutes Define an EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME constant that returns how many minutes the lasagna should bake in the oven. According to your cookbook, the Lasagna should be in the oven for 40 minutes: >>> lasagna.EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME 40 2. Calculate remaining bake time in minutes Implement the bake_time_remaining() function that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as an argument and returns how many minutes the lasagna still needs to bake based on the EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME. >>> bake_time_remaining(30) 10 3. Calculate preparation time in minutes Implement the preparation_time_in_minutes() function that takes the number of layers you want to add to the lasagna as an argument and returns how many minutes you would spend making them. Assume each layer takes 2 minutes to prepare. >>> preparation_time_in_minutes(2) 4 4. Calculate total elapsed cooking time (prep + bake) in minutes Implement the elapsed_time_in_minutes() function that has two parameters: number_of_layers (the number of layers added to the lasagna) and elapsed_bake_time (the number of minutes the lasagna has been baking in the oven). This function should return the total number of minutes you've been cooking, or the sum of your preparation time and the time the lasagna has already spent baking in the oven. >>> elapsed_time_in_minutes(3, 20) 26 5. Update the recipe with notes Go back through the recipe, adding notes and documentation. def elapsed_time_in_minutes(number_of_layers, elapsed_bake_time):     """"""     Return elapsed cooking time.      This function takes two numbers representing the number of layers & the time already spent      baking and calculates the total elapsed minutes spent cooking the lasagna.

Bank Project In this project you will have 3 files:  bank.py client.py main.py  bank.py  You will have class Bank. This bank will have instance variable name and class variable clients list. Initially this list will be empty. This class will have method add_client method which appends the client to list And lastly this class will have authentication method which takes name and account_number as parameters and authenticates the client  client.py  You will have class Client inside this file. Class Client will have account dictionary as the class variable. This dictionary will keep following info: ""account_number, name, total_amount"" __init__ method will initialize this variables, it will take name and total_amount as params and will assign a random 5 digit int to account_number Lastly this class will have withdraw, deposit and balance methods.  main.py  This class initially will create a bank object with a name you choose and then will print the following menu (it should print this menu, until user says exit) [hint: use while loop]:  Welcome to International Bank!  Choose an option:      1. Open new bank account     2. Open existing bank account     3. Exit  Then it will take the user input:  If it is 1, create an account First ask the name and then the deposit amount to user:  To create an account, please fill in the information below. Name:  Deposit amount:   After this, it creates the account and prints the menu again Account created successfully! Your account number is:  88194  Choose an option:      1. Open new bank account     2. Open existing bank account     3. Exit   If it is 2, asks following info  To access your account, please enter your credentials below. Name: Account Number:  First asks name and then account number. If credentials are wrong, print following, and then print the menu again: Authentication failed! Reason: account not found.  If credentials are correct, prints the following menu: Authentication successful!  Welcome irem!  Choose an option:      1. Withdraw     2. Deposit     3. Balance     4. Exit  And according to user input you can withdraw, deposit money. Or see the current balance. If input is 1, asks for withdraw amount: Withdraw amount:  And according to user input witdraws the amout and prints the menu again. The sum of 100 has been withdrawn from your account balance.  Your current account balance is: 900  If input is 2, asks for deposit amount: Deposit amount:  And according to user input, in this case 300. Prints following:  The sum of 300 has been added to your account balance.  Your current account balance is: 1200  If input is 3, shows the current balance: Your current account balance is: 1200   If input is 4, it goes back to other menu.  And lastly, in the main menu, if user input is 3: close the program  1.2. UML Draw Use Case and Class Diagrams for this project. 2. UML Class Diagram Consider the code in file uml_class.py.

There are currently 2 rules:  File size filtering: <comparator> <integer> <file size unit> Timestamp filtering: <comparator> <timestamp> comparator: ""lt"" or ""gt"" meaning ""less than"" and ""greater than"" respectively. file size unit: ""G"" or ""M"" or ""K"" meaning gigabyte, megabyte and kilobyte respectively timestamp: ""DD_MM_YYYY"" or ""DD_MM_YYYY:hh_mm_ss"" Example python3 files_manager.py --root /path/to/root/directory -V -r --sort date --filter gt 21_05_2021:13_44_18 The above tree becomes: SIZE (byte)     DATE       TIME     PATH 146,947,693     21-05-2021 13:44:18 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_1/folder_1/file_19 58,223,158      21-05-2021 13:44:35 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/file_8 2,697           21-05-2021 13:44:35 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/file_7 1,236,016,848   21-05-2021 13:50:20 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/file_10 119,965,643     21-05-2021 13:50:50 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/file_12 129,131,325     21-05-2021 13:51:23 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_1/folder_1/file_20 1,056,284,105   21-05-2021 13:55:51 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/file_11 121,736,117     21-05-2021 13:56:22 /path/to/root/directory/folder_0/folder_0/folder_0/folder_2/file_9 674,644,297     05-10-2021 08:39:22 /path/to/root/directory/folder2/file_21 361,543,919     14-10-2021 08:07:51 /path/to/root/directory/file_0  Finally, to remove all the files that are shown after applying all the filters, use --remove  python3 files_manager.py --root /path/to/root/directory -V -r --sort date --filter gt 21_05_2021:13_44_18 --remove Of course, you can remove the files directly using the rule without outputing in the console. Though, it's safer to visualise the tree first. python3 files_manager.py --root /path/to/root/directory -r --filter gt 21_05_2021:13_44_18 --remove "

Os neurônios em uma camada convolucional não estão totalmente conectados a cada pixel na imagem de entrada, como em uma rede neural tradicional. Em vez disso, eles são conectados a um pequeno retângulo de pixels na imagem de entrada. Por sua vez, cada neurônio da segunda camada convolucional está conectado apenas a outros neurônios localizados em uma região específica da primeira camada. Com essa arquitetura, o modelo só precisa se concentrar nos pequenos detalhes da primeira camada oculta, como bordas, e depois montá-los em recursos mais elaborados na segunda camada e assim por diante. Além disso, isso fará com que a rede neural convolucional tenha muito menos parâmetros do que uma rede totalmente conectada, útil para processar imagens de grande porte.

Package Description and Functions construct_diwv()  This function returns a dictionary that maps pairs of amino acids to an instability score based on the ProtParam Instability Index. The index is included, but you are welcome to use any other index.  passes_filters()  This function creates filters that will be used on the generated novel protein sequences and let those that satisfy the filter’s specifications return as a valid sequence. This function currently has filters for sequence length and sequence stability and instability. These filters can be modified accordingly for your protein or enzyme, and you can also add your own filters for any other property that you are interested in analyzing.  run_rnn()  This is the main function that takes an input of training sequences, and will return new sequences based on the specified filters from passes_filters(). This function has the most adaptability, as you can adjust any of the parameters involved here to whatever you’d like. The ones we used specifically for our PETase work are included here.

Table of Contents  General Info Technologies Used Setup Usage Project Status Room for Improvement Contact  General Information  It is a simple made-by-me minimax algorithm fitted into a game of tic-tac-toe. It is written in Python and does not use any libraries that need to be installed via pip. Idea was to try writing more of a real algorithm, seeing how well I can do. It seems to work rather well and through my testing I have not noticed any issues. Although it seems to work well, other algorithms seem to win a game of tic-tac-toe more often. My algorithm might be under-performing, but not sure on that. It currently does not use alpha-beta prunning.  Technologies used  Python 3.7+  Setup Simply copy the repository and run python main.py with at least Python 3.7. It uses dataclasses, which after version 3.7 were added as a built-in library to python. Nothing else is needed. Usage  After launch you will be prompted to choose players. Your options are HUMAN, AI-EASY and AI-HARD. AI-EASY chooses spots at random. AI-HARD uses the algorithm. Next you will be asked to choose algorithm search depth if you had chosed hard ai. Usually numbers between 6 and 10 work best. After that you will be able to play! Simply type in the number of your preferred cell when prompted and get ready to be squashed by the AI! Or vice versa.  Project Status Project is complete, but might receive update if I will feel like improving on it. Room for Improvement  Alpha-beta prunning Optimizing the code itself more Some GUI? Would require an external library.  Contact Created by s25429 AKA ThatHoracy, but currently posted on an account using school email address (this one!)  Email: s25429@pjwstk.edu.pl

417957551;bitey;https://github.com/jgerrish/bitey;Python;2021-10-16T21:54:52Z;0;0;0;bitey  Bitey is a 6502 CPU emulator.  It is currently not feature-complete, cycle-accurate or any of those things.  It's meant to be a simple clean emulator for a classic chipset.  It may possibly be expanded to include emulation of 8-bit systems in the future. It uses a simple JSON format for describing the CPU architecture. Why not VHDL or Verilog or insert-hardware-description-language? I'm not an electrical engineer.  I don't have access to the common simulation environments or experience working with the intricacies of those languages.  JSON provides a middle-ground between most existing classic 8-bit emulators and full-blown hardware definition in a language. The target audience of this application is those who want a simple understanding of emulation and a clean-ish base to work from. There are some existing projects that are more focused on those design patterns. Apple2fpga by Stephen A. Edwards at Columbia Univeristy http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/apple2fpga/ AppleLogic includes links to other projects. http://www.applelogic.org/ AppleIIe for MiSTer https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Apple-II_MiSTer FPGA-64 https://www.syntiac.com/fpga64.html I haven't examined all of these, but I'm pointing them out for those who are more interested in a more formal approach. Install pipenv was used to setup dependencies.  Feel free to use your Python package-manager of choice.  A Pipfile is included for installing dependencies. $ pip install -U pipenv $ pipenv install $ pipenv shell Running $ python -m bitey.app Development Design There are some design decisions that were implemented that may seem inconsistent. First, ordering of parameters in the Register, Flag and Instruction classes differs.  For Register and Flag, short_name and name are first, followed by size or bit_field_pos.  For the Instruction class, name and opcode are first, followed by description. It's called the description field instead of short_name and name because the name of the instruction is for example LDA.  This inconsistency may be changed later. The opcode field comes before the description field because name and opcode are the two primary elements used when manipulating instructions. Bus Design Most of the components, like instructions, flags and registers had simple designs.  The CPU buses provided different design challenges:  The model should be simple and not introduce synchronization / concurrency issues. The API should be easy to understand.  The requirements are that the CPU should be able to request items (instructions or data) from memory and get those items back.  And it should be able to write data to memory locations.  Research needs to be done on the synchronization requirements and how the true hardware deals with this (clocks, etc). Tests To run tests: $ pipenv run python -m pytest Linting This package uses black and flake8 for linting and style checking. I'm not strict on some of the recommended lints, but you can run them if you want. $ pipenv run flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics $ pipenv run flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics $ pipenv run black --check --diff . Focus is on making sure the tests run.

Description This python module can be used to monitor and control Tesla Energy Gateway Powerwalls. It uses a single class (Powerwall) and simple functions to fetch energy data and poll API endpoints on the Gateway. pyPowerwall will cache the authentication headers and API call responses for up to 5s to help reduce the number of calls made to the Gateway (useful if you are polling the Powerwall frequently for trending data).  Works with Tesla Energy Gateways - Powerwall+ Simple access through easy to use functions using customer credentials Will cache authentication to reduce load on Powerwall Gateway Will cache responses for 5s to limit number of calls to Powerwall Gateway  NOTE: This module requires that you (or your installer) have set up customer credentials on your Powerwall Gateway. Setup You can clone this repo or install the package with pip.  Once installed, pyPowerwall can scan your local network to find th IP address of your Tesla Powerwall Gateway. # Install pyPowerwall python -m pip install pypowerwall  # Scan Network for Powerwalls python -m pypowerwall scan Programming with pyPowerwall After importing pypowerwall, you simply create a handle for your Powerwall device and call function to poll data.  Here is an example:     import pypowerwall      # Optional: Turn on Debug Mode     # pypowerwall.set_debug(True)      # Credentials for your Powerwall - Customer Login Data     password='password'     email='email@email.com'     host = ""10.0.1.123""               # Address of your Powerwall Gateway     timezone = ""America/Los_Angeles""  # Your local timezone       # Connect to Powerwall     pw = pypowerwall.Powerwall(host,password,email,timezone)      # Pull Sensor Power Data     grid = pw.grid()     solar = pw.solar()     battery = pw.battery()     home = pw.home()      # Display Data     print(""Battery power level: %0.0f%%"" % pw.level())     print(""Combined power metrics: %r"" % pw.power())     print("""")      # Display Power in kW     print(""Grid Power: %0.2fkW"" % (float(grid)/1000.0))     print(""Solar Power: %0.2fkW"" % (float(solar)/1000.0))     print(""Battery Power: %0.2fkW"" % (float(battery)/1000.0))     print(""Home Power: %0.2fkW"" % (float(home)/1000.0))     print("""")      # Raw JSON Payload Examples     print(""Grid raw: %r\n"" % pw.grid(verbose=True))     print(""Solar raw: %r\n"" % pw.solar(verbose=True)) pyPowerwall Module Class and Functions  Classes     Powerwall(host, password, email, timezone)   Functions      poll(api, jsonformat)   # Fetch data from Powerwall API URI (return json if True)     level()                 # Fetch battery power level percentage     power()                 # Fetch power data returned as dictionary     site(verbose)           # Fetch site sensor data (W or raw json if verbose=True)     solar(verbose):         # Fetch solar sensor data (W or raw json if verbose=True)     battery(verbose):       # Fetch battery sensor data (W or raw json if verbose=True)     load(verbose)           # Fetch load sensor data (W or raw json if verbose=True)     grid()                  # Alias for site()     home()                  # Alias for load()  Credits and References  Tesla Powerwall 2 – Local Gateway API documentation – https://github.com/vloschiavo/powerwall2 Python Tesla Powerwall API – https://github.com/jrester/tesla_powerwall TESLA PowerWall 2 Security Shenanigans – https://github.com/hackerschoice/thc-tesla-powerwall2-hack Powerwall Monitoring – https://github.com/mihailescu2m/powerwall_monitor  "

Overview of Election Audit The purpose of this audit is to quickly tally the ballots in the included .csv file in order to provide a breakdown of the voting results by both canidate and county. During the breakdown we also present the winning canidate, along with the county with the highest voter turnout. Election Audit Results  How many votes were cast in this congressional election?  Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.  Which county had the largest number of votes?  Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each canidate recieved.  Which canidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?   Election Audit Summary To summarize, this script is already capable of quickly tallying votes and sorting those votes by county. As the script stands currently it could be used in any election where the data is available to be sorted to include county information in addition to canidate voted for. The script could also easily be modified to work without counties being provided. In addition, the script could be expanded upon to show information such as which canidate has the highest vote count in each county, as well as many other statistics.

See https://github.com/jpegleg/salsa_falcon This is a template, edit it from here for a real use. Probably want to make that api token something more useful. Replace mycoolsalsafalcon in the template with your salsa_falcon server DNS name or IP. Replace the URI context /api/encrypt/1 etc, with the URI contexts you configure in your salsa_falcon routes. This client template takes in a YAML file called struct.yml which defines encryption and decryption salsa falcon endpoints as well as data to encrypt and decrypt. The program could be expanded to have multiple yaml files loaded and processed etc. This example has two client threads to two different salsa_falcon servers, encrypting some strings.

They are short well-commented scripts that I've written to support my research activities. The scripts are primarily focused on enabling the expert bench researcher to generate and manipulate nucleic acid sequences as well as prepare, execute, and analyze NGS experiments from start to finish (while learning some Python in the process). The scripts are run from the command line in Terminal (Mac, PC, Linux). If this is new to you, don't worry. I've written a simple guide (see GETTING_STARTED.txt) that will get you up an running in 30 minutes or less even if you've never used the command line before. All of the Python (.py) and bash (.sh) scripts are run as follows:   Open your preferred command line terminal application.   Navigate to the location of the script.   At the command line prompt (using "">"" below as an example) enter the following and press enter:  name_of_the_script.ext argument_1 argument_2 argument_3 ... argument_n    The ""arguments"" could be DNA sequences, chromosome coordinates, or some customizable options you want to tell the script to use. Just read the script header for instructions. Many of the tools rely on tools that others have created called ""dependencies"" that will be listed in the script headers or the import sections below them. If you've already learned how to use pip or conda or you've already read GETTING_STARTED.txt, then you know what to do. Feel free to use, modify, repurpose, and stitch them together with others to make the scripts you need. I enjoy coding for fun. If you need a simple script that isn't here or elsewhere, let me know and I'll give it a try if I have the time! "

Potential tasks / additionals:  jupyter notebook support even more helpful output stronger diffing abilities better UX (particularly when things go wrong) so much code cleanup - like a lot :p  Notice: this is a in-progress rewrite of the original diff-shades. I'm rewriting it as the code was quite unmaintainable as I built it wayy too fast. This time I'm focusing on building a good project structure, prettifying the output, and improving functionality. The thing is that this is a WIP so the claimed features above aren't accurate right now.

AugmentedPCA can be split into two general families of models: adversarial AugmentedPCA and supervised AugmentedPCA. Supervised AugmentedPCA In supervised AugmentedPCA (sAPCA), the augmenting objective is to make the factors aligned with the data labels, or some outcome, in addition to having the factors explain the variance of the original observed or primary data. Below is a diagram depicting the relationship between primary data, supervision data, and the resulting sAPCA factors.  Adversarial AugmentedPCA In adversarial AugmentedPCA (aAPCA), the augmenting objective is to make the factors orthogonal to a set of concomitant data, in addition to having the factors explain the variance of the original observed or primary data. Below is a diagram depicting the relationship between primary data, concomitant data, and the resulting aAPCA factors.  Documentation Documentation for AugmentedPCA is available on this documentation site. Provided documentation includes:   Motivation - Motivation behind AugmentedPCA models and the different approximate inference strategies.   Model formulation - Overview of different models and approximate inference strategies as well as more in-depth mathematical descriptions.   Tutorials - Step-by-step guide on how to use the different offered AugmentedPCA models.   Examples - Use case examples for the different models.   Dependencies The AugmentedPCA library is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.6 to run. AugmentedPCA relies on the following libraries and version numbers:  Python >= 3.6 NumPy >= 1.19.2 SciPy >= 1.5.2  Installation To install the latest stable release, use pip. Use the following command to install: $ pip install augmented-pca  Issue Tracking and Reports Please use the GitHub issue tracker associated with the AugmentedPCA repository for issue tracking, filing bug reports, and asking general questions about the library or project. Quick Introduction A quick guide to using AugmentedPCA is given in this section. For a more in-depth guide, see our documentation. Importing AugmentedPCA Models APCA models can be imported from the models.py module. Below we show an example of importing the aAPCA model. # Import all AugmentedPCA models from apca.models import aAPCA Alternatively, all offered AugmentedPCA models can be imported at once. # Import all APCA models from apca.models import * Instantiating AugmentedPCA Models APCA models are instantiated by assigning either an aAPCA or sAPCA object to a variable. During instantiation, one has the option to define parameters n_components, mu, which represent the number of components and the augmenting objective strength, respectively. Additionally, approximate inference strategy can be defined through the inference parameter. # Define model parameters n_components = 2        # factors will have dimensionality of 2 mu = 1.0                # augmenting objective strength equal to 1  inference = 'encoded'   # encoded approximate inference strategy  # Instantiate adversarial AugmentedPCA model aapca = aAPCA(n_components=n_components, mu=mu, inference=inference) Fitting AugmentedPCA Models APCA models closely follow the style and implemention of scikit-learn's PCA implementation, with many of the same methods and functionality. Similar to scikit-learn models, AugmentedPCA models are fit using the fit() method. fit() takes two parameters: X which represents the matrix of primary data and Y which represents the matrix of augmenting data. # Import numpy import numpy as np  # Generate synthetic data # Note: primary and augmenting data must have same number of samples/same first dimension size n_samp = 100 X = np.random.randn(n_samp, 20)   # primary data, 100 samples with dimensionality of 20 Y = np.random.randn(n_samp, 3)    # concomitant data, 100 samples with dimensionality of 3  # Fit adversarial AugmentedPCA instance aapca.fit(X=X, Y=Y) Alternatively, AugmentedPCA models can be fit using the fit_transform() method, which takes the same parameters as the fit() method but also returns a matrix of components or factors. # Fit adversarial AugmentedPCA instance and generate components S = aapca.fit_transform(X=X, Y=Y) Approximate Inference Strategies In this section, we give a brief overview of the different approximate inference strategies offered for AugmentedPCA. Inference strategy should be chosen based on the data on which the AugmentedPCA model will be used as well as the specific use case. Both aAPCA and sAPCA models use the jointly-encoded approximate inference strategy by default. Local In the local approximate inference strategy, the factors (local variables associated with each observation) are included in both the likelihood relating and the augmenting objective. Below is a diagram from our paper depicting the local inference strategy.  Because the local variables are included in the augmenting objective, given new data we must have both primary and augmenting data to obtain factors. Thus, the local inference strategy should only be used for inference on new data when both primary and augmenting data are available. Below we show an example of how to fit a sAPCA model with local approximate inference strategy to training data and obtain factors for test data. # Import numpy import numpy as np  # Import supervised APCA from apca.models import sAPCA  # Generate synthetic data and labels n_samp = 100 X = np.random.randn(n_samp, 20) Y = np.random.randint(low=0, high=1, size=(n_samp, 1), dtype=int)  # Generate test/train splits train_pct = 0.7 idx = np.arange(start=0, stop=101, step=1, dtype=int) np.random.shuffle(idx) n_train = int(train_pct * len(idx)) train_idx = idx[:n_train] test_idx = idx[n_train:]  # Split data into test/train sets X_train = X[train_idx, :] X_test = X[test_idx, :] Y_train = Y[train_idx, :] Y_test = Y[test_idx, :]  # Instantiate supervised AugmentedPCA model with local approximate inference strategy sapca = sAPCA(n_components=3, mu=5.0, inference='local')  # Fit supervised AugmentedPCA model sapca.fit(X=X_train, Y_train)  # Generate components for test set # Note: both primary and augmenting data are needed to obtain factors S_test = sapca.transform(X=X_test, Y=Y_test) Note that when factors are generated for the test set that the transform() method requires both the primary data X_test and labels Y_test be passed as parameters. For a more in-depth description of the local approximate inference strategy, see our paper or the corresponding documentation section. Encoded In the encoded approximate inference strategy, a linear encoder is used to transform the data into factors or components. This inference strategy is termed ""encoded"" because the augmenting objective is enforced via the encoder. Below is a diagram depicting the encoded inference strategy.  In contrast to the local inference strategy, when factors are generated for the test set under the encoded inference strategy the transform() method only requires the primary data X_test. Below we show an example of how to fit a sAPCA model with encoded approximate inference strategy to training data and obtain factors for test data. # Instantiate supervised AugmentedPCA model model with encoded approximate inference strategy sapca = sAPCA(n_components=3, mu=5.0, inference='encoded')  # Fit supervised AugmentedPCA model # Note: both primary and augmenting data are required to fit the model sapca.fit(X=X_train, Y_train)  # Generate components for test set # Note: only primary data are needed to obtain factors S_test = sapca.transform(X=X_test) For a more in-depth description of the encoded approximate inference strategy, see the corresponding documentation section. Jointly-Encoded The jointly-encoded approximate inference strategy is similar to the encoded in that the augmenting objective is enforced through a linear encoding matrix. However, in the jointly-encoded inference strategy both the primary and augmenting data are required for computing factors, similar to the local inference strategy. Below is a diagram depicting the jointly-encoded inference strategy.  Similar to the local inference strategy, when factors are generated for the test set under the jointly-encoded inference strategy the transform() method requires both the primary data X_test and augmenting data Y_test. Below we show an example of how to fit a sAPCA model with jointly-encoded approximate inference strategy to training data and obtain factors for test data. # Instantiate supervised AugmentedPCA model model with encoded approximate inference strategy sapca = sAPCA(n_components=3, mu=5.0, inference='encoded')  # Fit supervised AugmentedPCA model # Note: both primary and augmenting data are required to fit the model sapca.fit(X=X_train, Y_train)  # Generate components for test set # Note: both primary and augmenting data are needed to obtain factors S_test = sapca.transform(X=X_test) For a more in-depth description of the jointly-encoded approximate inference strategy, see our paper or the corresponding documentation section.

Freitas' DENSPLOT (non-published). Also inspired by Brett Bode's wxMacMolPlt Powered by Python / NumPy / MatPlotLib 1. WHAT IS GPF-PLOT?  GPF-PLOT is a Python script which generates 2D plots of orbitals, electronic densities and GPF density partitioning associated to VB2000 output files. 2. CHANGELOG  Version 0.2, October 2021:  Minor changes for adjusting to VB2000 3.0 / GAMESS 2021 R2 versions. Fixed error in normalization formula. Fixed parse_overlaps when there is more than 10 groups. Fixed parse_gpf when SPHER keyword is on. Added feature to save EPS file and customize Figure DPI.  Version 0.1, July 2020:  Initial release.  3. HOW TO RUN GPF-PLOT  GPF-PLOT uses Python 3.x, so it needs to be installed in your machine. Additional requirements are the NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries. The current version of GPF-PLOT (0.2) was tested with Python 3.8.2, NumPy 1.17.4, and MatPlotLib 3.1.2. If the above dependencies are installed, you should be able to run GPF-PLOT by entering the following command in your terminal (you must be in the directory which contains the script): python3 gpfplot.py INPUTFILE where INPUTFILE is a *.gpfplot valid input file. 4. PROGRAM MODES  Currently, GPF-PLOT has 6 program modes: ORB, HFORB, QC, INT, TOT, and PROMPT. ORB and HFORB are respectively for plotting VB2000 and GAMESS output orbitals. QC, INT, and TOT are for plotting the total electronic density (TOT) or its quasi-classical (QC) or interference (INT) densities, for a given set of orbitals. PROMPT is an interactive prompt mode, in which you can ask for the program to plot orbitals and/or densities. For more instructions about the modes, please see the TUTORIAL.md file. 5. HOW TO WRITE THE INPUTFILE  Although INPUTFILE must have the *.gpfplot extension, it is just a plain text in which INPUT VARIABLES are set. In order to set variables, type the name of the variable, followed immediately by an equal sign =, followed immediately by the variable value. Do not use spaces before or after the equal sign. Each line must contain only 1 variable (or none). Variables can be defined in any order. If a variable is defined more than once in the INPUTFILE, the program reads ONLY the FIRST definition and ignore the rest. Lines starting with # are comments (ignored by the program). 5.1 INPUT VARIABLES 5.1.1 Input Files and program mode    VARIABLE DEFAULT VALUE DESCRIPTION     out_file - Name of GAMESS/VB2000 output file with extension.   dens_file - Name of the density matrix file generated by VB2000.   mode PROMPT Action which the program will perform. Possible values:PROMPT: interactive prompt.ORB N: plot Nth VB orbital.HFORB N: plot Nth HF orbital.QC X Y Z:  plot quasi-classical density of orbitals X, Y, Z, ...INT X Y Z: plot interference density of orbitals X, Y, Z, ... (minimum of 2 orbitals).TOT X Y Z: plot total density of orbitals X, Y, Z, ...    5.1.2 Geometry Settings    VARIABLE DEFAULT VALUE DESCRIPTION     plane xy Spatial plane where densities will be evaluated (options: xy, xz, yz, yx, zx, zy).   gridp 50 Number of points of the generated grid in each dimension (2D plot).   xlim -1,1 Range for horizontal axis of the plot (Å).   ylim -1,1 Range for vertical axis of the plot (Å).   offset 0.0 Value of the coordinate parallel to cartesian plane chosen for plotting.    5.1.3 Plot Settings    VARIABLE DEFAULT VALUE DESCRIPTION     c_lines yes Option for plotting isovalue lines (yes/no).   c_fill yes Apply filled contour plot (yes/no).   c_label no Include labels int the isovalue lines (yes/no).   color_f coolwarm (mode = ORB, HFORB or PROMPT)seismic_r(mode = QC, INT or TOT) Colormap for filled contour plot. See section [6.1] for available colormaps.   color_l - Colormap for isovalue lines. If not set, lines will be plotted in black. See section [6.1] for available colormaps.   nconts 10 Number of contour isolines and/or color changes in filled contour plot.   min_c -1.0(mode = ORB, HFORB or PROMPT)-0.1(mode = QC, INT or TOT) Minimum value for contour isovalue lines.   max_c 1.0(mode = ORB, HFORB or PROMPT)-0.1(mode = QC, INT or TOT) Minimum value for contour isovalue lines.   auto_c no If set yes, it defines min_c and max_c automatically according to the range of grid values.   p_unit angs Length unity in the plot axes. If not set angs (Å), plot will be shown in atomic units (Bohr radius).   draw_atom plane Which atoms will be shown on the plot. Possible values:all: All atoms are projected on the plotted plane and shown on the plot.plane: Only atoms on the plotted plane and 0.1 Å or less away from the plotted plane are shown on the plot.none: No atom is shown on the plot.   draw_name yes Whether atoms are represented on the plot by name (the labels given in $DATA section from GAMESS). If ""no"", atoms are represented by a black dot.    5.1.4 External File Settings    VARIABLE DEFAULT VALUE DESCRIPTION     save_png -   (300) File name for saving the plot as a *.png image. The variable is optional and is not used if mode = PROMPT. The second argument must be separated by a blankspace and corresponds to the figure resolution in DPI (dots per inch). The default value is 300.   save_eps -   (300) File name for saving the plot as a *.eps  image. The variable is optional and is not used if mode = PROMPT. The second argument must be separated by a blankspace and corresponds to the figure resolution in DPI (dots per inch). The default value is 300.   save_txt - File name for saving the grid points of the plot in a text file (*.txt). The variable is optional and is not used if mode = PROMPT. The format specification is quite intuitive and can be seen in the tutorial example.    Please check the file TUTORIAL.md for further information. 6. RESOURCES  6.1 AVAILABLE COLORMAPS Matplotlib provides a huge number of colormaps. They can be checked out here. The recommended colormaps for using in GPF-PLOT are shown in the image examples/useful_colormaps.png. My personal favorite is coolwarm for plotting orbitals and seismic_r for plotting densities. These are the default colormaps mentioned above. Hint: all colormaps can be reversed by adding _r at the end of its name. 6.2 The gpfplot_figure SCRIPT This script is an extra resource, used for generating high-quality figures intended for publishing in papers or books. The figure may contain more than one orbital or density plot. Check TUTORIAL.md for information about how to use it. 7. FINAL REMARKS  There are some improvements wanted for a newer version, but I do not know when I will be able to work on it. Although, any suggestions are welcome. Since the program has not been fully tested, it probably may have bugs. You can send questions and suggestions to Dr. David Sousa. I will be glad to answer any questions and receive any suggestions on improving the program. "

Do you want to enter the field of Data Science? Are you intimidated by the coding you would need to learn? Are you looking to learn python to switch to a data sceince career?  Most industry experts recommend starting your Data Science journey with python Across biggest companies and startups,Pyton is the most used language for Data Science and Machine learning Projects Stackoverflow survey for 2019 had Python outrank java in the list of most loved language Python is a very versatile language since it has a wide array of functionalities already available. The sheer range of functionalities might sound too exhaustive and complicated, you don’t need to be well-versed with them all. Most data scientists have a few go-to libraries for their daily tasks like:   for performing data cleaning and analysis - pandas for basic statistical tools – numpy, scipy for data visualization – matplotlib, seaborn  Why Python and how popular is it for Data Science?  Python has rapidly become the go-to language in the data science space and is among the first things recruiters search for in a data scientist's skill set. It consistently ranks top in global data science surveys and its widespread popularity will only keep on increasing in the coming years. Over the years, with strong community support, this language has obtained a dedicated library for data analysis and predictive modelling.  What does a Data Scientist do?  Data Science is an amalgamation of Statistics, Computer Science and specific domain knowledge. As more and more data gets generated across the world, we need to leverage it to make decisions and improve them. A data scientist performs operations on the data provided to analyze and interpret it.  Which companies use Python? Many of the biggest and most popular companies use Python. Some of them are:  Google, NASA, Amazon Social networking sites like Instagram, Reddit, Quora, etc Media streaming companies like Netflix and Spotify Rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft “Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we are looking for more people with skills in this language.”   Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google Inc.  So get onboard the Data Science train by learning Python and upskill yourself!

Dev-env, super-easy mode (docker all things) Requirements:  Install docker Learn Python and Django Learn vue.js Learn Nuxt.js Get familiar with Vuetify.js components  Step by step source dev.sh  # import useful bash functions devhelp  # like this one ;) dkbuild  # builds the docker image for this project. The first time Will take a while. dknpminstall  # I'll explain later! dkup  # Brings up everything With dkup running, open another terminal dk bash  # starts bash inside ""djavue-python-brasil"" container ./manage.py migrate  # create database tables and stuff ./manage.py createsuperuser  # creates an application user in the database What is happenning:  dev.sh is a collection of useful bash functions for this project's development environment. You're encouraged to look inside and see how that works, and add more as the project progresses. dknpminstall will start a docker container and run npm install inside to download node dependencies to the frontend/node_modules folder. Using docker for this means you don't need to worry about installing (and choosing version for) node/npm. dkup uses docker-compose to start 3 containers: postgres, nginx, and djavue-python-brasil. The dockerized postgres saves its state into docker/dkdata. You can delete that if you want your dev database to go kaboom. Once dkup is running, dk <command> will run <command> inside the djavue-python-brasil container. So dk bash will get you ""logged in"" as root inside that container. Once inside, you need to run Django's manage.py commands to initialize the database properly. The djavue-python-brasil container runs 3 services: django on port 8000 nuxt frontend with real APIs on port 3000 nuxt frontend with mock APIs on port 3001 nginx is configured to listen on port 80 and redirect to 8000 (requests going to /api/*) or 3000 (everything else). Therefore, when dkup is running, you get a fully working dev-environment by pointing your browser to http://localhost, and a frontend-only-mock-api-based environment by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3001. Each one is more useful on different situations. You're supposed to create features first by implementing them on 3001, then validate them, and only then write the backend APIs and integrate them. Experience shows this process is very productive.  2. Dev-env, normal-easy mode (dockerize nginx + postgres) Running everything inside docker is a quick and easy way to get started, but sometimes we need to run things ""for real"", for example, when you need to debug python code. Python setup Requirements:  Understand about python virtualenvs Install virtualenvwrapper (not required, but recommended)  Step by step dkpgnginx  # Starts postgres and nginx inside docker With dkpgnginx running, start another terminal: mkvirtualenv djavue-python-brasil -p python3  # creates a python3 virtualenv pip install -r requirements.txt  # install python dependencies inside virtualenv export DJANGO_DB_PORT=5432  # That's where our dockerized postgres is listening ./manage.py runserver  # starts django on port 8000 Since nginx is also running you go ahead and point your browser to http://localhost/admin and you should see the same thing as in http://localhost:8000/admin Node Setup Requirements:  Install nvm (not required, but highly recommended)  Step by step: nvm use 12  # Switch your terminal for node version 9.x # no need to npm install anything, we already have our node_modules folder sudo chmod -R o+rw .nuxt/  # I'll explain this later npm run dev  # Starts nuxt frontend on port 3000 You can go ahed and point your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see nuxt running with mocked apis To run nuxt using real APIs just turn set this environment variable API_MOCK=0 API_MOCK=0 npm run dev  # Starts nuxt frontend on port 3000 Since nginx is also running you go ahead and point your browser to http://localhost/ and you should have a fully integrated frontend+backend dev env. 3. Deploy to production Rent a linux machine on a cloud somewhere. Let's say you'll be using ubuntu on AWS. Install docker and nginx. Create an empty postgres database djavue-python-brasil owned by a user djavue-python-brasil. On your remote machine, create a file ~/djavue-python-brasil.env: DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD=<djavue-python-brasil's password> DJANGO_DB_HOST=<database_ip> DJANGO_DB_NAME=djavue-python-brasil DJANGO_DB_USER=djavue-python-brasil DJANGO_DEBUG=0  Have a nginx config serving your domain like: server {     server_name  djavue-python-brasil.example.com;      location /api {         proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/api;     }     location /admin {         proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/admin;     }     location /static {         alias /home/ubuntu/dkdata/djavue-python-brasil/static;         add_header Cache-Control public;         add_header ETag """";     }     location / {         proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;     }      listen 80; }  (Replace ""djavue-python-brasil.example.com"" with your production domain) On your development environment, edit the HOST_PROD variable on dev.sh to make it point to your production domain, then run on terminal: source dev.sh deploy_prod  If it works the first time, go have a beer and take the day off :-) "

I am unsure on how to have first if statement only print buy info once until the next if statement sell occurs. I also want it to loop back to the first if statement once the sell occurs. I have set the ftm_low * 1.13 to see the buy info more frequently. Ideally, you would want to set this at 1.01 to get within 1% of the 24 hour low on the buy. I look forward to see what others might add to this. Thank you, @sktrth

If you notice something is not working (like the API, or any of the links in this document), please contact hello@hatchways.io. This assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria: ● Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases? ● Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and well organized? ● Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data structures? ● Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests, avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of choice? ● Completion speed: A fast completion time comparable to the completeness of your solution. This is the least important criteria. We use the following rubric to evaluate your submission. Please note that if your submission does not attempt to complete all of the requirements, we will be unable to provide feedback on it. Resources If you are not familiar with how to set up a basic API, we recommend the following resources: ● Python - Flask (Flask JSON API) ● Javascript - Node + Express ● Java - Spring Boot (JSON API) ● Ruby - Rails JSON API You may use Javascript (Node.js), Python, Ruby, Java, Go, or Rust to complete this assessment. You may use any framework for your language of choice. Please document in a Readme how to start the application. Data Source You will be building an API that requires you to fetch data from this API: Request: Route: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/blog/posts Method: GET Query Parameters: Field Type Description tag String (required) The tag associated with the blog post. Notice that the parameter is a query parameter - you can read more about query parameters here. An example of sending the tag parameter is https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/blog/posts?tag=tech. Our API can only filter one tag at a time - notice that the field “tag” is singular and not plural. It will return a JSON object with an array of blog posts. An example response is: { ""posts"": [{ ""id"": 1, ""author"": ""Rylee Paul"", ""authorId"": 9, ""likes"": 960, ""popularity"": 0.13, ""reads"": 50361, ""tags"": [ ""tech"", ""health"" ] }, ... ] } API Requirements You need the following routes in your API: Route 1: Request: Route: /api/ping Method: GET Response: Response body (JSON): { ""success"": true } Response status code: 200 Route 2: Request: Route: /api/posts Method: GET Query Parameters: Field Type Description Default Example tags String (required) A comma separated list of tags. N/A science,tech sortBy String (optional) The field to sort the posts by. The acceptable fields are: ● id ● reads ● likes ● popularity id popularity direction String (optional) The direction for sorting. The acceptable fields are: ● desc ● asc asc asc Successful Response: The API response will be a list of all the blog posts that have at least one tag specified in the tags parameter. The sortBy parameter specifies which field should be used to sort the returned results. This is an optional parameter, with a default value of id. The direction parameter specifies if the results should be returned in ascending order (if the value is ""asc"") or descending order (if the value is ""desc""). The default value of the direction parameter is asc. Here is how the response should look: Response body (JSON): { ""posts"": [{ ""id"": 1, ""author"": ""Rylee Paul"", ""authorId"": 9, ""likes"": 960, ""popularity"": 0.13, ""reads"": 50361, ""tags"": [ ""tech"", ""health"" ] }, ... ] } Response status code: 200 Error Responses: If tags parameter is not present: Response body (JSON): { ""error"": ""Tags parameter is required"" } Response status code: 400 If a sortBy or direction are invalid values, specify an error like below: Response body (JSON): { ""error"": ""sortBy parameter is invalid"" } Response status code: 400 Here is what you will need to do to complete this task: ● For every tag specified in the tags parameter, fetch the posts with that tag using the Hatchways API (make a separate API request for every tag specified) ● Combine all the results from the API requests above and remove all the repeated posts (try to be efficient when doing this) ● You will get a better score on our assessment if you can make concurrent requests to the API (making the requests in parallel) (we understand that this job is easier in some languages vs. others) We have provided an API with the correct solution. This should only be used to verify your results. Do not call this API in your application. Here it is in action: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/solution/posts?tags=history,tech&sortBy=likes&di rection=desc Step 3 An important part of development is testing. In this step, we want to see tests written for your routes. Do not use the solutions API route to perform testing in this step. Think about the different ways to test the app, and the best way to get good coverage. Step 4 (Bonus!) Making API calls to other servers can be expensive. How can you reduce the number of calls you make to a server? You can cache the results of an API call on your server. Try to implement a server side cache to our API. Two tips are 1) keep it simple, and 2) feel free to use existing libraries/frameworks. Be sure to test your code after implementing this to be sure it still works as expected. Checklist Before submitting your assessment, make sure you have: ❏ An /api/posts route that handles the following query parameters: ❏ tags (mandatory) : any number of comma-separated strings ❏ sortBy (optional) : one of “id”, “reads”, “likes”, “popularity” ❏ direction (optional) : one of “asc”, “desc”, defaults to “asc” ❏ Error handling: Return an error message if: ❏ tags parameter is missing ❏ sortBy or direction has an invalid value ❏ Testing without using our solution API route ❏ Caching (bonus) Submission Details Please submit your code in a compressed folder on the Hatchways platform. The max submission size is 5MB. Upon clicking the submission button, you will see a form as pictured below. We need this information to be able to test your application.  Choose which language and additional technologies you used to develop your solution. Be sure to select the appropriate version for the language you have used. Provide us with the install command, the run command, and the port that you used to run your application. If you cannot find your commands in our suggestions, simply type your own and select “Use command”. Please note that these commands will be used to run automated tests, so filling in every relevant field and providing accurate commands will allow you to receive feedback more quickly on your submission. If you have any notes to provide about your submission, please put them in a README, not in the submission form. Additionally, note that the install and run commands will be run from the root level of your submission, so please organize your files accordingly. Do not submit any built folders, since the compressed folder will be too large. Do not submit your external dependencies (like the node_modules folder), since the compressed folder will be too large. We will be installing your dependencies before we run your code. If your submission is too big and you can't figure out how to compress, you are welcome to email your solution to hello@hatchways.io. Please include your name, and use the email you signed up with on the Hatchways platform. Use the subject line “Back-end Assessment Submission”. Public Repositories Do not post your solution to a public repository. We understand that you may want to share projects you have worked on, but many hours go into developing our tools so we can provide a fair skills evaluation.  "
417979040;Python_APIs_Challenge;https://github.com/LilianaPinzon/Python_APIs_Challenge;Jupyter Notebook;2021-10-17T00:15:22Z;0;0;0;"Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like? Background Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: ""What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"" Now, we know what you may be thinking: ""Duh. It gets hotter..."" But, if pressed, how would you prove it?  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside the repository folder you just created, add new files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.   Push the above changes to GitHub.   Adding A .gitignore File We don't want the api_keys.py file containing the API key to be exposed to the public on GitHub, as this would mean anyone could copy and use our API key, possibly causing us to incur charges. When we type git status in the command line, we can see all the files we have created so far that are untracked. If we only wanted to add the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub we could type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. However, every time we want to add a new file or update current files to the repository, we have to add each file individually, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. Instead, we can add the files we don't want to track to the .gitignore file. Before we add our files to GitHub, let's add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file. Follow these steps:   Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.   Open the .gitignore file, and on the first line type the following:   # Adding config.py file. api_keys.py   While the .gitignore file is open, add the API_practice.ipynb and random_numbers.ipynb files and save the file.   In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should say the .gitignore file has been modified and the WeatherPy.ipynb file is untracked.   Use git add, git commit, and git push to commit the modifications to .gitignore and the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub.   On GitHub, the only new file you should see is the WeatherPy.ipynb file. Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities. The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each plot, add a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing. The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude  After each pair of plots, take the time to explain what the linear regression is modeling. For example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have. Your final notebook must:  Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name. Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.  Part II - VacationPy Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to plan future vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.   Note: Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure you can't be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform Billing and Manage your cost of use for more information.   Note: if you having trouble displaying the maps, try running jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and retry.   To complete this part of the assignment,you will need to do the following:   Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.    Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:   A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.   Wind speed less than 10 mph.   Zero cloudiness.   Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.   Note: Feel free to adjust to your specifications but be sure to limit the number of rows returned by your API requests to a reasonable number.     Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.   Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.    As final considerations:  You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook. You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries. For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission. You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels. For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.  Hints and Considerations   The city data you generate is based on random coordinates as well as different query times. As such, your outputs will not be an exact match to the provided starter notebook.   If you'd like a refresher on the geographic coordinate system, this site has great information.   Next, spend the requisite time necessary to study the OpenWeatherMap API. Based on your initial study, you should be able to answer basic questions about the API: Where do you request the API key? Which Weather API in particular will you need? What URL endpoints does it expect? What JSON structure does it respond with? Before you write a line of code, you should be aiming to have a crystal clear understanding of your intended outcome.   A starter code for Citipy has been provided. However, if you're craving an extra challenge, push yourself to learn how it works: citipy Python library. Before you try to incorporate the library into your analysis, start by creating simple test cases outside your main script to confirm that you are using it correctly. Too often, when introduced to a new library, students get bogged down by the most minor of errors -- spending hours investigating their entire code -- when, in fact, a simple and focused test would have shown their basic utilization of the library was wrong from the start. Don't let this be you!   Part of our expectation in this challenge is that you will use critical thinking skills to understand how and why we're recommending the tools we are. What is Citipy for? Why would you use it in conjunction with the OpenWeatherMap API? How would you do so?   In building your script, pay attention to the cities you are using in your query pool. Are you getting coverage of the full gamut of latitudes and longitudes? Or are you simply choosing 500 cities concentrated in one region of the world? Even if you were a geographic genius, simply rattling 500 cities based on your human selection would create a biased dataset. Be thinking of how you should counter this. (Hint: Consider the full range of latitudes).   Once you have computed the linear regression for one chart, the process will be similar for all others. As a bonus, try to create a function that will create these charts based on different parameters.   Remember that each coordinate will trigger a separate call to the Google API. If you're creating your own criteria to plan your vacation, try to reduce the results in your DataFrame to 10 or fewer cities.   Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file.   Lastly, remember -- this is a challenging activity. Push yourself! If you complete this task, then you can safely say that you've gained a strong mastery of the core foundations of data analytics and it will only go better from here.

Please submit separate pull requests for each solution you work on. In general solutions should fall into one of the following three categories:  algorithm demonstration. This is the primary type of problem and solution that the text is concerned with. As such, solutions should not use standard library functions in cases that would make it unnecessary to implement the algorithm. The goal of these solutions should be to have an easy to understand solution that demonstrates understanding of the algorithm. python demonstration. We also accept solutions that solve the problem in a more practical way, using whatever standard library functions are available. Please do not use any third party dependencies. These solutions should also be easy to understand and good examples of pythonic ways of doing things. speed demonstration. These alternative solutions may be accepted if the fastest way to do something is not very readable or intuitive and thus it doesn't fit into the first two categories.   ⚖️ License This project is Public Domain and licensed under the MIT License.   🌎 Contact me If you have any questions about this project, feel free to get in touch.

If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out HELP.md. If you get stuck on the exercise, check out HINTS.md, but try and solve it without using those first :) Introduction A str in Python is an immutable sequence of Unicode code points. These could include letters, diacritical marks, positioning characters, numbers, currency symbols, emoji, punctuation, space and line break characters, and more. Being immutable, a str object's value in memory doesn't change; methods that appear to modify a string return a new copy or instance of that str object. A str literal can be declared via single ' or double "" quotes. The escape \ character is available as needed. >>> single_quoted = 'These allow ""double quoting"" without ""escape"" characters.'  >>> double_quoted = ""These allow embedded 'single quoting', so you don't have to use an 'escape' character"".  >>> escapes = 'If needed, a \'slash\' can be used as an escape character within a string when switching quote styles won\'t work.' Multi-line strings are declared with ''' or """""". >>> triple_quoted =  '''Three single quotes or ""double quotes"" in a row allow for multi-line string literals.   Line break characters, tabs and other whitespace are fully supported.    You\'ll most often encounter these as ""doc strings"" or ""doc tests"" written just below the first line of a function or class definition.     They\'re often used with auto documentation ✍ tools.     ''' Strings can be concatenated using the + operator. This method should be used sparingly, as it is not very performant or easily maintained. language = ""Ukrainian"" number = ""nine"" word = ""девять""  sentence = word + "" "" + ""means"" + "" "" + number + "" in "" + language + "".""  >>> print(sentence) ... ""девять means nine in Ukrainian."" If a list, tuple, set or other collection of individual strings needs to be combined into a single str, <str>.join(<iterable>), is a better option: # str.join() makes a new string from the iterables elements. >>> chickens = [""hen"", ""egg"", ""rooster""] >>> ' '.join(chickens) 'hen egg rooster'  # Any string can be used as the joining element. >>> ' :: '.join(chickens) 'hen :: egg :: rooster'  >>> ' 🌿 '.join(chickens) 'hen 🌿 egg 🌿 rooster' Code points within a str can be referenced by 0-based index number from the left: creative = '창의적인'  >>> creative[0] '창'  >>> creative[2] '적'  >>> creative[3] '인' Indexing also works from the right, starting with a -1-based index: creative = '창의적인'  >>> creative[-4] '창'  >>> creative[-2] '적'  >>> creative[-1] '인' There is no separate “character” or ""rune"" type in Python, so indexing a string produces a new str of length 1: >>> website = ""exercism"" >>> type(website[0]) <class 'str'>  >>> len(website[0]) 1  >>> website[0] == website[0:1] == 'e' True Substrings can be selected via slice notation, using <str>[<start>:stop:<step>] to produce a new string. Results exclude the stop index. If no start is given, the starting index will be 0. If no stop is given, the stop index will be the end of the string. moon_and_stars = '🌟🌟🌙🌟🌟⭐' sun_and_moon = '🌞🌙🌞🌙🌞🌙🌞🌙🌞'  >>> moon_and_stars[1:4] '🌟🌙🌟'  >>> moon_and_stars[:3] '🌟🌟🌙'  >>> moon_and_stars[3:] '🌟🌟⭐'  >>> moon_and_stars[:-1] '🌟🌟🌙🌟🌟'  >>> moon_and_stars[:-3] '🌟🌟🌙'  >>> sun_and_moon[::2] '🌞🌞🌞🌞🌞'  >>> sun_and_moon[:-2:2] '🌞🌞🌞🌞'  >>> sun_and_moon[1:-1:2] '🌙🌙🌙🌙' Strings can also be broken into smaller strings via <str>.split(<separator>), which will return a list of substrings. The list can then be further indexed or split, if needed. Using <str>.split() without any arguments will split the string on whitespace. >>> cat_ipsum = ""Destroy house in 5 seconds mock the hooman."" >>> cat_ipsum.split() ... ['Destroy', 'house', 'in', '5', 'seconds', 'mock', 'the', 'hooman.']   >>> cat_ipsum.split()[-1] 'hooman.'   >>> cat_words = ""feline, four-footed, ferocious, furry"" >>> cat_words.split(',') ... ['feline', 'four-footed', 'ferocious', 'furry'] Separators for <str>.split() can be more than one character. The whole string is used for split matching. >>> colors = """"""red, orange, green, purple, yellow""""""  >>> colors.split(',\n') ['red', 'orange', 'green', 'purple', 'yellow'] Strings support all common sequence operations. Individual code points can be iterated through in a loop via for item in <str>. Indexes with items can be iterated through in a loop via for index, item in enumerate(<str>). >>> exercise = 'လေ့ကျင့်'  # Note that there are more code points than perceived glyphs or characters >>> for code_point in exercise: ...    print(code_point) ... လ ေ ့ က ျ င ် ့  # Using enumerate will give both the value and index position of each element. >>> for index, code_point in enumerate(exercise): ...    print(index, "": "", code_point) ... 0 :  လ 1 :  ေ 2 :  ့ 3 :  က 4 :  ျ 5 :  င 6 :  ် 7 :  ့ Instructions You are helping your younger sister with her English vocabulary homework, which she's finding very tedious. Her class is learning to create new words by adding prefixes and suffixes. Given a set of words, the teacher is looking for correctly transformed words with correct spelling by adding the prefix to the beginning or the suffix to the ending. There's four activities in the assignment, each with a set of text or words to work with. 1. Add a prefix to a word One of the most common prefixes in English is un, meaning ""not"". In this activity, your sister needs to make negative, or ""not"" words by adding un to them. Implement the add_prefix_un() function that takes word as a parameter and returns a new un prefixed word: >>> add_prefix_un(""happy"") 'unhappy'  >>> add_prefix_un(""manageable"") 'unmanageable' 2. Add prefixes to word groups There are four more common prefixes that your sister's class is studying: en (meaning to 'put into' or 'cover with'), pre (meaning 'before' or 'forward'), auto (meaning 'self' or 'same'), and inter (meaning 'between' or 'among'). In this exercise, the class is creating groups of vocabulary words using these prefixes, so they can be studied together. Each prefix comes in a list with common words it's used with. The students need to apply the prefix and produce a string that shows the prefix applied to all of the words. Implement the make_word_groups(<vocab_words>) function that takes a vocab_words as a parameter in the following form: [<prefix>, <word_1>, <word_2> .... <word_n>], and returns a string with the prefix applied to each word that looks like: '<prefix> :: <prefix><word_1> :: <prefix><word_2> :: <prefix><word_n>'. >>> make_word_groups(['en', 'close', 'joy', 'lighten']) 'en :: enclose :: enjoy :: enlighten'  >>> make_word_groups(['pre', 'serve', 'dispose', 'position']) 'pre :: preserve :: predispose :: preposition'  >> make_word_groups(['auto', 'didactic', 'graph', 'mate']) 'auto :: autodidactic :: autograph :: automate'  >>> make_word_groups(['inter', 'twine', 'connected', 'dependent']) 'inter :: intertwine :: interconnected :: interdependent' 3. Remove a suffix from a word ness is a common suffix that means 'state of being'. In this activity, your sister needs to find the original root word by removing the ness suffix. But of course there are pesky spelling rules: If the root word originally ended in a consonant followed by a 'y', then the 'y' was changed to to 'i'. Removing 'ness' needs to restore the 'y' in those root words. e.g. happiness --> happi --> happy. Implement the remove_suffix_ness(<word>) function that takes in a word str, and returns the root word without the ness suffix. >>> remove_suffix_ness(""heaviness"") 'heavy'  >>> remove_suffix_ness(""sadness"") 'sad' 4. Extract and transform a word Suffixes are often used to change the part of speech a word has. A common practice in English is ""verbing"" or ""verbifying"" -- where a adjective becomes a verb by adding an en suffix. In this task, your sister is going to practice ""verbing"" words by extracting an adjective from a sentence and turning it into a verb. Fortunately, all the words that need to be transformed here are ""regular"" - they don't need spelling changes to add the suffix. Implement the noun_to_verb(<sentence>, <index>) function that takes two parameters. A sentence using the vocabulary word, and the index of the word, once that sentence is split apart. The function should return the extracted adjective as a verb. >>> noun_to_verb('I need to make that bright.', -1 ) 'brighten'  >>> noun_to_verb('It got dark as the sun set.', 2) 'darken' Source Created by  @aldraco @bethanyg  "

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix. The returned dictionary should follow this format: {   'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],   'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],   'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],   'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],   'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],   'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened] } If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: ""List must contain nine numbers."" The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays. For example, calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) should return: {   'mean': [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0],    'variance': [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666], 6.666666666666667],    'standard deviation': [[2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178], [0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726], 2.581988897471611],   'max': [[6, 7, 8], [2, 5, 8], 8],   'min': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 6], 0],   'sum': [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36] } The unit tests for this project are in test_module.py.

418006669;Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV;https://github.com/chaojin/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV;Jupyter Notebook;2021-10-17T03:14:16Z;0;0;0;Face Detection with Python using OpenCV   Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This technique is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings or cars) in digital images and videos. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing. Objective This is the repository linked to the tutorial with the same name. The idea is to introduce people to the concept of object detection in Python using the OpenCV library and how it can be utilized to perform tasks like Facial detection. Blogpost Face Detection with Python using OpenCV Installation OpenCV-Python supports all the leading platforms like Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. It can be installed in either of the following ways: 1. From pre-built binaries and source : Please refer to the detailed documentation here for Windows and here for Mac. 2. Unofficial pre-built OpenCV packages for Python. Packages for standard desktop environments (Windows, macOS, almost any GNU/Linux distribution) run pip install opencv-python if you need only the main modules run pip install opencv-contrib-python if you need both main and contrib modules (check extra modules listing from OpenCV documentation) Table Of Contents  Images as Arrays Images and OpenCV Basic Operations on Images Face Detection  Images as Arrays An image is nothing but a standard Numpy array containing pixels of data points. More the number of pixels in an image, the better is its resolution. You can think of pixels to be tiny blocks of information arranged in form a 2 D grid and the depth of a pixel refers to the colour information present in it. In order to be  processed by a computer, an image needs to be converted into a binary form. The colour of an image can be calculated as follows:   Number of colours/ shades = 2^bpp where bpp represents bits per pixel.  Naturally, more the number of bits/pixels , more possible colours in the images. The following table shows  the relationship more clearly. Let us now have a look at the representation of the different kinds of images:  Binary Image Grayscale image Coloured image  Images and OpenCV In this section we will perform simple operations on images using OpenCV like opening images, drawing simple shapes on images and interacting with images through callbacks. This is necessary to create a foundation before we move towards the advanced stuff.  Importing Images in OpenCV Open CV Using Jupyter notebooks OpenCV Using Python Scripts Savings images  Basic Operation on Images In this section, we will learn how we can draw various shapes on an existing image to get a flavour of working with OpenCV.  Drawing on Images Functions & Attributes Writing on Images  Face Detection Face detection is a technique that identifies or locates human faces in digital images. A typical example of face detection occurs when we take photographs through our smartphones, and it instantly detects faces in the picture. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection detects merely the presence of faces in an image while facial recognition involves identifying whose face it is. Face detection is performed by using classifiers. A classifier is essentially an algorithm that decides whether a given image is positive(face) or negative(not a face). A classifier needs to be trained on thousands of images with and without faces. Fortunately, OpenCV already has two pre-trained face detection classifiers, which can readily be used in a program. The two classifiers are: Haar Classifier and Local Binary Pattern(LBP) classifier. Haar feature-based cascade classifiers  1. 'Haar features' extraction 2. 'Integral Images' concept 3. 'Adaboost': to improve classifier accuracy 4.

This started as a literature homework. The task was to bring some newspaper to school so we can try to create a dada poem using cut out words. But seriously, who reads newspaper in 21st century? I didn't have any, I always read news online. So... Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Created a really simple program that was randomly choosing words from an article and put it into something looking like a poem. Later I worked a bit more and added randomness to more factors (since dadaism should be random), the possibility to set the number of stanzas/verses/words (but lol, you won't affect the final result that much) and also the rhyme feature. Whatever you want your poem to be generated from (should be a text, the longer the better the chances of getting some cool stuff), put it into the txt doc called ""dadadata"" (or anything else but don't forget to change the code). Right now it contains the text you're currently reading so I recommend to change it before you run the program. Not sure about the results in different languages. Rhymes are created by words with the same last two letters here, it works fine in my native language but english has different pronounciation and it most likely won't be that good. But seriously who cares, it's dada, it doesn't need rhymes. "

Please see the API Specification for full details. Installation The package can be installed via pip: pip install py_helium_console_client Usage To use the Console API, you will first need to generate an API Key from the 'My Account' tab. Use this key to initialize the ConsoleClient class. This interface exposes any of the methods in the specification (at the time of writing), which includes programmatic access for creating, querying, and deleting devices and labels. Some example commands are shown below. See examples.py for full usage. from py_helium_console_client.client import ConsoleClient  API_KEY = 'PASTE_API_KEY_HERE'  client = ConsoleClient(API_KEY)  # list devices on account devices = client.get_devices()  # search for a device by uuid uuid_device = client.get_device_by_uuid(devices[0].id)  # get device events events = client.get_device_events(devices[0].id)  # create device created_device = client.create_device(name='python-client-test-device',                               app_key='850AFDC6F1CF2397D3FEAB8C1850E6E1',                               app_eui='B21C36EBBDC0D75F',                               dev_eui='ABA47D469E1021AF')  # list labels labels = client.get_labels()  # create label created_label = client.create_label('python-client-test-label')  # search for label by id queried_label = client.search_for_label(created_label.id)  # add label to device add_label_result = client.add_device_label(created_device.id, created_label.id)  # remove label from device remove_label_result = client.remove_device_label(created_device.id, created_label.id)  # delete device deleted_device_result = client.delete_device(created_device.id)  # delete label deleted_label_result = client.delete_label(created_label.id) Contributing This is a small project that I use for developing my own applications on the Helium Network.

418011701;Password-generator;https://github.com/Haneen-Heeba/Password-generator;;2021-10-17T03:47:49Z;0;0;0;Password-generator Security is one of the most crucial parts of our lives. The importance of security is increasing day by day as most things are going online. Passwords come into light as we talk about security. Password Generator 🔢 : The best thing about creating our own password generator is that we can customize it as we like. First, we will create a password generator that asks the length of the password and generates a random password containing digits, alphabets, and special characters. Next, we will improve it by asking the number of each type of character, like the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters. Steps for creating a password generator :  Store all the characters as a list. We can use the string module of Python or type all of them. Ask the user to enter the length of the password. Shuffle the characters using the random.shuffle method. 4.Initialize an empty list to store the password. Write a loop that iterates length times. Pick a random character from all the characters using the random.choice method. Append the random character to the password. Shuffle the resultant password list to make it more random. Convert the password list to string using the join method. Print the password.
